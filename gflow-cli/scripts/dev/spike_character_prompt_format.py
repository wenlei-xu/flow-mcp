"""Spike: read the character-editor "Format" button's anchor off live DOM (#383, #727).

Dumps every icon-ligature carrier in the character editor with its host button, so the
Format button's locale-stable anchor is measured instead of guessed — on **either**
frontend. labs.google renders ligatures in ``<i class="google-symbols">``; the migrated
``flow.google.com`` Angular frontend renders the same ligatures in ``<mat-icon>``.

Two runs behind this file:

* **2026-07-27 (labs)** — confirmed the ligature is ``personal_recommendations``, that
  the button carries no ``aria-label`` (the label is a ``<span>`` child), and that it
  ships ``disabled`` while the prompt box is empty.  See ``PROMPT_FORMAT_SELECTORS``.
* **2026-09-07 (migrated, #727)** — ``PROMPT_FORMAT_SELECTORS`` stopped matching and
  ``character create --format-prompt`` degraded to a silent no-op.  This probe was
  rewritten to be carrier-agnostic, to type into the prompt box (the button is disabled
  until then, so an empty-box read measures the wrong state), and to carry a **control**.

**Two controls, and both fail AFTER the dump, never before it.**  A selector sweep that
returns zero everywhere is worthless unless something *known present* also resolved in
the same run — otherwise "nothing matched" and "the probe never reached the editor" are
the same observation.  So the script records (1) that the editor-ready anchor resolves
and (2) that the typed text actually landed in the box — the second is the load-bearing
one, because a click that hits a consent overlay leaves the box empty, the Format button
disabled, and produces a false absence indistinguishable from a real measurement.

Both raise, but only from a ``finally`` that has already written the capture and the
screenshots.  ``skills/spike/SKILL.md``: *never put a guard in front of a probe* — a
fail-fast that runs before the evidence is collected deletes the evidence that would
correct it, which is exactly how #701 made a false claim unfalsifiable.

FREE — navigation, a free tRPC ``createEntity``, DOM reads and typing.  Nothing is
submitted, nothing is generated, no credit and no image quota is spent, and a scratch
entity the spike minted is deleted again on the way out.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/dev/spike_character_prompt_format.py --project <id> [--entity <id>]

Without ``--entity`` a fresh (free) scratch entity is minted: a character that already
has images renders a saved view with no prompt composer and no button.
