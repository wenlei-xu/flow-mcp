"""Which rpc fires when a reference is attached? — passive, no submit, $0.

Records every ``batchexecute`` POST the migrated editor makes, stamped with the phase it
fired in, across: idle → `@` typed → "Add to prompt" clicked → prompt typed. **Nothing is
submitted**, so unlike the submit-payload probe there is not even a theoretical path to
spending a credit.

**Why this exists.** The attach recon
(`docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-09-05-migrated-r2v-attach-surface.md`) established that
references attach through an `@` picker, captured its selectors, and then failed four
times to make anything stick — clicking an asset dismisses the picker, and clicking
"Add to prompt" leaves the composer empty. So no submit payload could be produced, and the
question that gates the whole r2v port — *does the confirm attach an entity server-side,
or only write prompt text?* — stayed open.

But the traffic already carries the answer. Two rpcids, ``UpteDb`` and ``DTaVef``, showed
up in every capture and are unaccounted for. If one of them fires **on the confirm click**
carrying an asset id, the attach is server-side, the composer being empty is a red herring,
and the port asserts the rpc rather than scraping the prompt box. If none fires, the
mechanism really is prompt-text and the port has to defend against a run that silently
generates without its references.

Phase stamping is the whole point: an rpc that also fires while idle proves nothing.
