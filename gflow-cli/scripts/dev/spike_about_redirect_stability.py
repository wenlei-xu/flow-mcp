"""Spike: is `flow.google.com/about` a TRANSIENT landing or a STABLE one? (#756)

**The question, and why it needs measuring.** Routing the `/about` landing to
``FlowAppError`` gives it exit 31's retry semantics, because ``is_retryable`` is
class-level (``errors.py``). Whether a retry helps is therefore an assertion the
code makes on every occurrence — and nobody has measured it. #756 measured the
redirect and explicitly declined to measure its cause; this measures only whether
it *repeats*, which is a different and answerable question.

**Method.** N sequential ``MigratedComposer.ensure_editor`` calls against one
project on one profile, recording where each landed via the production
``flow_landing_kind`` — never a local copy of the predicate. No generation, no
upload, no prompt submitted: **zero credits.** Not read-only, though: a
non-``/about`` failure reaches ``_exit_agent_mode``, which clicks a chip Flow
remembers per account. Same shape as the 2026-09-04 migrated-host
mechanism spike that settled ``FlowHostMigratedError``'s retryability (5/5, 7/7).

**How to read the result.**

| Outcome | Reading |
|---|---|
| N/N `/about` | stable for this account — a retry is doomed; must NOT be retryable |
| mixed | it flaps — a retry can win; retryable is defensible |
| 0/N `/about` | **does not reproduce today.** Settles NOTHING about
  retryability — absence of a reproduction is not evidence of transience |

**Scope, stated up front.** One profile is one account, and per
``flow-capabilities-are-cohort-dependent`` an account is not a cohort. This
answers "does it repeat for THIS account, now" — nothing wider.
