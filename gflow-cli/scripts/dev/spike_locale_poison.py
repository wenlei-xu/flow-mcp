"""Does Flow correct a wrong-but-valid locale segment? (#587). Zero credits.

This is the load-bearing experiment behind #587's design. The issue assumed a
stale cached locale is self-correcting — *"a stale value produces one redirect,
which the #584 settle already tolerates"*. If that were true, the fast design
(navigate straight to the cached ``/fx/{seg}/...`` and skip the settle) would be
safe, and it saves ~3 s on every account rather than only the non-redirecting
ones.

It is not true. Run this and read the CONTROL row against the POISON row.

Measured 2026-08-27 on a pt-BR account, poisoned with ``de``:

    arm      requested              landed                 lang
    control  /fx/tools/flow?hl=en   /fx/pt/tools/flow      pt     <- Flow chose pt
    poison   /fx/de/tools/flow      /fx/de/tools/flow      de     <- served as asked

The conclusion rests on the LANDED column, not on ``lang``: both arms carry
``?hl=en``, which the path segment overrides, so ``lang`` has been observed both
``en`` and ``pt`` on the control across runs.

Flow serves whatever segment it is asked for. No redirect, so no correction
signal ever arrives, and the UI renders in a language the account never chose —
for as long as the stale value lives. Hence the shipped design: the cache decides
whether to WAIT, never where to GO, and only a bare navigation is evidence.

The second half asserts the shipped recovery: a cache poisoned with a SEGMENT
heals on the very next ordinary run, because that run navigates bare and rewrites
the locale from what Flow answers.

Restores the profile's original cache value on the way out.
