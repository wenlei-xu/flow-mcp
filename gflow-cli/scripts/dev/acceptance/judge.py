"""Judges: things that look at a contact sheet and say what is wrong with it.

Two implementations, which is why :class:`FrameJudge` is a port rather than a class:
:class:`VisionFrameJudge` asks a real model, and :class:`ScriptedFrameJudge` returns
canned answers so the benchmark harness can be tested with no network and a known answer.

Provider names appear nowhere in this file. Where the judge lives is
:mod:`acceptance.settings`, resolved from ``GFLOW_CLI_LLM_*``.

_PROMPT = """You are grading ONE generated video clip for temporal defects.

The image is a contact sheet: {cells} frames of the clip "{clip}", sampled at {fps} frame
per second, in order, left to right then top to bottom. Cell 0 is the first frame.

Every frame may look fine on its own. You are looking ONLY for things that are wrong
ACROSS the sequence. Report only these failures, by these exact names:

- object_scale_drift : something grows or shrinks across cells while the camera is still
- materialisation    : an object, or a fragment of one, is absent in early cells and
                       present later, or the reverse
- identity_swap      : a face that is one person early and a different person later
- wardrobe_change    : a garment, colour or prop that changes between cells
- background_morph   : terrain, horizon or architecture that rearranges behind held subjects
- extra_subject      : the number of people or limbs changes between cells
- axis_break         : a subject crosses to the wrong side of frame mid-shot

Answer with JSON only, no prose and no code fence:

{{"verdict": "accept" | "reject",
  "findings": [{{"failure": "<one name above>", "first_cell": <int>,
                 "evidence": "<what you saw, and in which cells>"}}]}}

"accept" means you found none of the above; its findings list MUST be empty.
"reject" means you found at least one; list every one you are confident of.
Do not report ordinary camera movement, lighting change, or wind in cloth as a defect."""
