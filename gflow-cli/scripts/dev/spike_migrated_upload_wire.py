r"""What actually goes out when the migrated editor is handed a local file? ($0, #719)

`gflow video i2v --initial-frame <local>` and `r2v --ref <local>` both die on the migrated
host with ``MediaUploadRejectedError`` (exit 27) — *"no maseQ reply within 60s of choosing
the file"*. #719 lists four candidates and says the logs cannot separate them.

**Three of the four are already ruled out by the error class**, and that is worth stating
before spending a run on them. ``_upload_via_toolbar`` raises a DISTINCT
``UiSelectorDriftError`` when the toolbar ``+`` is missing, when the menu renders no
``upload`` entry, and when that entry opens no file chooser. A reporter holding
``MediaUploadRejectedError`` therefore already knows the affordance was found, the menu
opened, the chooser fired, and ``set_files`` was called. What is left is narrower:

  (a) the upload went out under a rpcid that is no longer ``maseQ``
  (b) it went out on ``maseQ`` and Flow did not answer inside the budget
  (c) nothing went out at all — the app took the file and never asked the network,
      or it uploads over something that is not ``batchexecute`` in the first place

Only (a) is fixed by changing a constant, and today all three present identically.

This drives **the real driver method**, not a re-implementation of it — the point is to
see what the shipped code sees — with a listener on EVERY request, not just
``batchexecute``. A parallel probe that uploaded some other way could disagree with the
product and teach us nothing.

**Cost: zero.** An upload is not a generation; no submit is clicked and no Veo credit can
be reached from here. Run it against a funded profile AND a drained one: #721 established
that a credit shortfall changes what this host renders, and whether that CAUSES the upload
failure or merely travelled with it is still open.
