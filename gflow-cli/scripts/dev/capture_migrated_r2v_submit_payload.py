"""Does "Add to prompt" attach a reference, or only write text? — route-aborted, $0.

Drives the real migrated composer: Ingredients sub-mode, an `@` mention picked from the
composer's own picker, "Add to prompt", a prompt, then **submit with the generate request
aborted**, and prints what the page was about to send.

**Why this exists.** The 2026-09-05 attach recon
(`2026-09-05-migrated-r2v-attach-surface.md`) established that references on the migrated
host attach through an `@` picker in the composer, not through labs-shaped slots. It did
NOT establish what the confirm does. Two possibilities, and they demand different ports:

* "Add to prompt" **attaches an entity** — the submit carries reference ids, and a port can
  assert them the way the labs backstop `_assert_entities_attached` does; or
* it only **inserts prompt text** — the submit carries a decorated prompt and nothing else,
  in which case an r2v run could silently generate an *unreferenced* clip and the port has
  to defend against exactly that.

Nothing short of the outgoing payload distinguishes them, and
[[credit-free-route-abort-verification]] is how this repo reads one without paying.

**Credit safety.** The labs technique routes `video:batchAsyncGenerateVideo*`; this host
submits over `batchexecute` (rpcid ``YhhmEf``), so the filter had to change. It is
deliberately **blunt**: from the moment the route is armed — immediately before the submit
click — *every* `batchexecute` POST is aborted, not just the one matching the rpcid. A
missed filter here costs a real generation, and nothing else on the page needs to succeed
after the click. The run is torn down straight after.
