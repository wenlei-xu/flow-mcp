"""Nightly live-e2e canary — local scheduled run, published to a rolling issue (#502).

Hosted CI cannot run the live tiers: they need a real authenticated Chrome
profile, and Google bot-detection / reCAPTCHA / ToS make hosted auth infeasible.
So the canary runs on the maintainer's machine — where the warm profile already
lives — and publishes a sanitized result to GitHub.

Four states, and the canary **gates nothing** (a gate on a machine that might be
off is self-DoS):

    GREEN         every selected tier passed AND at least one test actually ran
    RED           auth was healthy but a $0 tier failed -> real drift/regression
    AUTH-EXPIRED  session rot; expected maintenance, not a regression
    DEFERRED      nothing conclusive ran (profile precondition, or all skipped)

Keeping AUTH-EXPIRED and DEFERRED out of RED is the whole point: RED must always
mean "code or Flow drifted", never "please re-login" or "you had Chrome open".
Otherwise the signal trains red-blindness and dies. The converse matters just as
much — see ``_PRECONDITION_RE`` for why a real failure must never be *demoted*
to DEFERRED.

Scope: ``-m e2e_auth`` only ($0, no reCAPTCHA). Generation tiers are refused outright
(see ``_MANUAL_ONLY_MARKERS``) — a promise in a docstring is not enforcement.

Publishing is sanitized for a public repo: SHA, counts, duration, failure class,
and failing test *base* names. Never raw logs, profile paths, prompts, signed
URLs, or parametrize ids.

Usage:
    # dry run — execute for real, print the payload, touch nothing on GitHub
    python scripts/canary/run_canary.py --profile ffroliva --dry-run

    # real run (rolling issue #559 must already exist; the canary never opens one)
    python scripts/canary/run_canary.py --profile ffroliva --issue 559

Exit codes: always 0 unless the canary ITSELF broke (bad args, gh failure).
The Flow-side verdict lives in the issue, not in this process's exit code —
a scheduled task that reports failure by exiting non-zero just fills the
Windows event log with noise nobody reads.
