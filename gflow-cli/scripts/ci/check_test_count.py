"""Fail when a pytest run executed fewer tests than the floor.

A green build that ran nothing is not green: a collection error, a bad marker
expression, or an accidental `-k` filter can skip most of the suite while the
job still exits 0. This gate parses the junit XML pytest wrote and requires a
minimum number of EXECUTED tests (collected minus skipped).

Usage:
    python scripts/ci/check_test_count.py <junit-xml> <min-executed>

Floors are deliberately well below the real counts so routine test deletions
never trip them — they exist to catch collapse, not drift.
