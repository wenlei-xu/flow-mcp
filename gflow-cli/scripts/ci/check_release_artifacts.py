"""Release-protocol guard — a release PR must carry the /gflow:release artifacts.

Enforces (for the version in pyproject.toml):
  1. ``src/gflow_cli/__init__.py`` ``__version__`` parity,
  2. a ``## [<version>]`` CHANGELOG section,
  3. CHANGELOG footer links: ``[<version>]: …compare/…v<version>`` and
     ``[Unreleased]: …compare/v<version>...HEAD``,
  4. ``docs/LIVE_VERIFICATION_v<version>.md`` exists (the step-4b gate),
  5. ``docs/INDEX.md`` references that live-verification doc,
  6. ``docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md``'s "## Current release" section names this
     version (added 2026-09-02 — see ``_project_status_violations``).

Run by the main-base guard workflow on PRs targeting ``main`` (release PRs).
Born 2026-07-17: v0.38.1 was initially cut WITHOUT /gflow:release — the missing
live-verification gate would have shipped a fix whose primary bug (the
composer-render race) only the live run exposed. Owner directive: all releases
must follow /gflow:release; this guard makes the documentation half structural.

Usage: python scripts/ci/check_release_artifacts.py [repo_root]
Exit 0 = all artifacts present; exit 1 = violations (each printed).
