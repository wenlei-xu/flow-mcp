# CLAUDE.md

> Project memory hub for **Claude Code**. The universal coding-agent rules for any tool (Cursor, Codex, Aider, Antigravity, etc.) live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) — this file carries Claude-Code-specific session protocol only.

## What this project is

`gflow-cli` is an unofficial Python CLI that drives [Google Flow](https://labs.google/fx/tools/flow) (Veo image-to-video, Imagen text-to-image) from the terminal by reverse-engineering Flow's private REST API. See [README.md](README.md) for the user-facing overview.

## System rules — loaded, not requested

**[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is imported below and is therefore already in context before
you read this line.** It is the system rule for this project: the `/gflow:` skills are
the default development lifecycle, and its Skill Routing table says which one to load
for the situation in front of you. Follow it — it is not advisory, and "I hadn't read
it yet" is not a reachable state.

> **Why an import and not a bullet that says "read AGENTS.md".** That bullet is what
> used to be here, and it failed exactly as written: an agent that skips it is not
> corrected by anything, and no gate notices. A session on 2026-09-01 went straight
> into work without it and reached step 10 of a release before discovering the
> pipeline's own doc-review and live-verification gates. `@AGENTS.md` removes the
> choice — the harness resolves the import and injects the file, with no agent
> cooperation required. Never downgrade this back to prose.

@AGENTS.md

## On every session start

1. Read **[docs/INDEX.md](docs/INDEX.md)** — routing layer for all project docs and
   commands. Deliberately *not* imported: at ~47 KB it is a lookup table, not a rule set,
   and AGENTS.md points into it. Read it when you need to find a doc.
2. Pull deeper context on demand:
   - Current task / where we left off → `/gflow:status`
   - Starting a new feature → `/gflow:predict` → `/gflow:scenario` → `/gflow:plan <feature>`
   - Touching auth or reCAPTCHA → `/gflow:known-issues`
   - Referencing a saved asset (`@Name` mention vs `--ref`/`--reference-entity`) → [docs/REFERENCE_STRATEGIES.md](docs/REFERENCE_STRATEGIES.md)
   - Cutting a release → `/gflow:release`
   - Before any commit → `/gflow:check`

## Claude-Code-specific

- Slash commands live under `.claude/commands/gflow/` (all prefixed `/gflow:`). **These
  are the invocable surface** — they appear in the session's skill list and may be called
  with the `Skill` tool as `gflow:<name>`.
- **`skills/<name>/SKILL.md` are the canonical bodies, and are NOT `Skill`-tool-invocable.**
  They are plain Markdown, agent-agnostic on purpose so Codex/Cursor/Aider can read the
  same file. `Skill(skill="release")` fails with `Unknown skill: release`; each wrapper in
  `.claude/commands/gflow/` says to read its `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` directly, and that is
  the supported path. (This bullet previously claimed they were "auto-discoverable", which
  is false and sends agents into a failing tool call.)
- Auto-memory at `~/.claude/projects/C--development-github-gflow-cli/memory/MEMORY.md` carries cross-session feedback and project state.
- **Worktrees:** the native `EnterWorktree` tool branches from `origin/main` (the default branch). Feature work integrates via `develop` — after entering a fresh worktree, immediately `git switch -c <type>/<name> origin/develop` and delete the auto-created `worktree-*` branch. On Windows, worktree removal can fail on a file lock (the worktree's `.venv`); `git worktree prune` + manual delete later is fine.

## MCP GitHub tool — PR body rule (non-negotiable)

When calling `mcp__github__create_pull_request` or `mcp__github__update_pull_request`, the `body` parameter **must be a plain string**. Shell heredoc syntax (`$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)`) is **never valid** here — MCP tool parameters are JSON, not shell; the heredoc is not evaluated and appears literally in the PR description.

```
# WRONG — produces literal "$(cat <<'EOF'" in the PR body:
body: "$(cat <<'EOF'\n## Summary\n...\nEOF\n)"

# CORRECT — plain multiline string:
body: "## Summary\n\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n\n## Test plan\n- [ ] ..."
```

The heredoc pattern (`$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)`) is only valid inside a `Bash` tool call because the **shell** evaluates it there. In every MCP tool parameter it is a literal string. This mistake has recurred across multiple PRs — treat this rule as a hard blocker before every PR creation or update.

## Active phase

See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) or run `/gflow:status` for current task. Run `/gflow:plan <feature>` to create a new feature plan.
