"""Smoke test for issue-#92 — Google account persistence and profile naming.

REAL ENVIRONMENT REQUIRED
--------------------------
These tests require a profile that was authenticated with ``gflow auth login``
against real Google Flow. They **cannot** run in CI, a sandbox, or any
environment without a live Google session. The tests skip automatically when
``GFLOW_CLI_E2E_PROFILE`` is unset or the named profile directory does not exist.

To run on a developer workstation or server::

    GFLOW_CLI_E2E_PROFILE=<name> pytest -m smoke tests/smoke/test_profile_account_smoke.py -v

Credit cost: zero — no image or video generation is performed.

What is verified
----------------
  1. ``.gflow_account`` file in the profile dir holds a valid email address.
  2. ``profile_store.list_profiles()`` surfaces that email in ``google_account``.
  3. ``gflow auth list --json`` returns the ``google_account`` key per entry.

Backfill behaviour
------------------
If ``.gflow_account`` is absent (profile created before the PR #110 fix), the
first two tests derive the email from ``verify_flow_session`` and write the file,
emulating what a fresh ``gflow auth login`` would do. The third test
(``test_auth_list_json_includes_google_account``) skips if the file is still
absent after that, since the CLI subprocess cannot write to the profile during
``--json`` output.

See ``docs/E2E_TESTING.md`` § Smoke test inventory and
``docs/AUTHENTICATION.md`` § Profile naming for full context.
