"""Shared pytest fixtures for the gflow-cli test suite.

The ``install_log_capture`` fixture replaces 4+ inline copies of
``structlog.configure(processors=[merge_contextvars, cap])`` scattered across
test files. Centralizing prevents the most likely regression: a new test that
needs to assert on a contextvar-bound field (e.g. ``correlation_id``) and
silently omits ``merge_contextvars`` from its processor chain, yielding
mysteriously-missing fields in the captured event dict.

``_isolate_settings`` is an autouse fixture that prevents the cached
``get_settings()`` singleton from ever resolving to the developer's real
``platformdirs`` paths during test runs. It writes ``GFLOW_CLI_HOME`` and
``GFLOW_CLI_DB_PATH`` to per-test tmp dirs, then clears the ``lru_cache``
before and after every test. Without this, any test that calls
``get_settings()`` without first patching the env will open — and write into
— the developer's production catalog (issue #86).

    A git worktree has no ``.venv`` of its own: the venv's editable install pins ``src/``

    TESTS against the main checkout's SOURCE — and it fails *open*. A release branch runs
    its own gates, sees green, and has validated code it is not shipping; a regression on
    that branch passes, because the other tree's healthy code answered for it.

    Caught during the v0.71.1 release only because one new assertion happened to differ
    between the two trees. Nothing structural would have caught it, which is why this is a
    hard error rather than a warning.

    Deliberately narrow: it fires only when a local ``src/gflow_cli`` exists beside these

    every ``tmp_path`` is a directory nested in a git repository: a test that shells

    search above the basetemp, turning the escape into a plain "not a git repository".
