"""Every dev script that checks a Page out of the pool must check it back in.

`FlowApiClient._checkout_page` is documented as blocking forever
(`api/client.py`: *"Waits indefinitely if the pool is exhausted (no Pages
available). Callers that need a deadline must wrap the call themselves"*), and
the pool is an `asyncio.Queue(maxsize=n)` that defaults to one page. So a script
that takes the only page and never returns it has not leaked a resource — it has
armed a deadlock that fires the moment anything else needs a page.

Nothing else usually does, which is why this sat latent in seven scripts. Every
`client.<verb>()` that talks to Flow goes through `_post_json` / `_patch_json`,
and those check a page out themselves. On 2026-09-07 `spike_character_prompt_format.py`
added a `client.delete_characters(...)` cleanup call in its `finally` — obeying
`skills/spike/SKILL.md`'s "delete anything the spike created" — and the script
stopped exiting. It had completed all of its work: the capture and all three
screenshots were on disk. It hung in teardown, holding the `denon82` profile
lease, with no error and no traceback, because `contextlib.suppress(Exception)`
cannot rescue a block.

A wedged process holding a profile lease is also what sends an operator to the
process list; see `test_spike_profile_lease.py` for the other half of that.

The 17 scripts that already pair the calls are the reference; `_post_json`'s own
`attempt()` in `api/client.py` is the canonical shape:

    page = await self._checkout_page()
    try:
        ...
    finally:
        self._checkin_page(page)

Offline and text-level on purpose: milliseconds, no browser, fires before a
spike is ever run. Watched failing against all seven scripts before the fix.
