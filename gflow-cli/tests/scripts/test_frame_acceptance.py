"""The frame-acceptance judge: a model that looks at a contact sheet and reports findings.

Every test here exists because of one failure on 2026-09-07: a beat whose background
monolith tripled in size and materialised top-down passed EVERY mechanical gate — bars,
stream lengths, audio, motion — and was caught by a human watching. The mechanical gates
are per-frame; that defect is temporal. The judge closes that gap, and these tests exist
to stop it closing the gap *dishonestly*.

The invariant almost every test below defends: **a judge that could not look must never
return "nothing found".** A truncated completion, an unparseable body, a model that cannot
actually see — each of those is an ERROR. Reporting them as a clean assessment is the same
"confidently empty" failure that produced blank incident bundles and a probe that declared
a feature absent because its click silently failed.
