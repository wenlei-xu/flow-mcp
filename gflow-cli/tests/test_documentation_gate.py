# 2026-09-07: two sessions worked this repo at once. One held the `denon82`
# lease; the other read `ProfileLockedError` as a stale lock, took a process
# list as better evidence than the lease, and killed eighteen Chrome processes
# — nine of them belonging to the running e2e suite. The lease was correct
# throughout. `tests/scripts/test_spike_profile_lease.py` pins the code half
# (no dev script launches Chrome outside a lease); nothing pins the half that
# would actually have prevented it, which is an instruction to an operator.
