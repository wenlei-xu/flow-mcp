"""Scenario #1 guardrail: character generation NEVER posts directly to a Flow
generation REST endpoint.

WHY this matters (Option B / 403 wall):
    Flow's image/video *generation* endpoints (``batchAsyncGenerateImage`` etc.)
    are reCAPTCHA/WAF-walled — a direct server-side ``POST`` is answered with
    HTTP 403 (mapped to ``WafRejectionError``; see commit 65c6393). The character
    feature therefore uses **Option B passive UI capture**: generation is driven
    through the UI-automation transport (``transport.generate_character_images``),
    and the captured workflow is read back. If a future refactor ever routed
    character generation through ``_post_json``/``batch_generate_images_url``, it
    would silently 403 in production while unit tests over fakes stayed green.

This module proves the invariant two independent ways so it cannot become
vacuous:

  1. **Runtime spy** — drive the *real* ``character_create`` saga through the
     *real* ``FlowApiClient.generate_character_image`` against a fake transport,
     with ``client._post_json`` and ``routes.batch_generate_images_url`` patched
     to record-and-explode. Assert generation went through the transport and the
     generation REST path was NEVER touched during character gen.

  2. **Source scan** — assert the saga module and the ``generate_character_image``
     method body contain no literal call to ``batch_generate_images_url`` or a
     ``_post_json`` generation POST. A static guard catches a regression even if
     someone adds a code path the runtime test doesn't exercise.
