"""Locale-segment extraction from a settled Flow URL (issue #580).

gflow hardcoded `locale="en-US"` for every account, so a pt-BR account was sent to
`/fx/en/...` and Flow redirected it to `/fx/pt/...` AFTER `page.goto` had already
returned — leaving the next DOM action operating on a page about to be navigated
away. The only trustworthy source of the account locale is where Flow itself lands
(`auth/session` carries no locale, and `navigator.language` reports the value gflow
sets at launch). This parses that landing URL.
