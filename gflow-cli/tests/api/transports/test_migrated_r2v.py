"""R2V on the migrated host: routing, upload, mention attach, and the submit rpc.

Deliberately NOT built on `test_migrated_composer.py`'s fake DOM. That fake models the
settings pane and the model menu; the reference path needs a mention picker, an upload
chooser and chips, and bolting those onto it would make one fake serve two very different
surfaces. These are small purpose-built doubles instead, each modelling exactly one
measured behaviour from
