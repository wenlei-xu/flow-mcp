"""The changelog modal must be cleared, provably, and never touched otherwise (#593).

Two layers, because they catch different things:

* **Real DOM** — the captured announcement markup driven by a headless Chromium.
  A mock cannot tell you whether ``[role='dialog']:has(a[href*='changelog']) button``
  actually resolves against Flow's markup; only a real CSS engine can. These tests
  need no account, no network and no credits, and skip when Chromium is absent.
* **Unit** — the decision logic (when Escape is allowed, what a failed dismissal
  returns), which is cheap to pin with mocks.

The #395 guard is the negative case: a healthy Flow dialog with no changelog anchor,
on a page that is *not* blocked, must come out completely untouched. That regression
sent a character generation out without ``entityContext`` and spent credits.
