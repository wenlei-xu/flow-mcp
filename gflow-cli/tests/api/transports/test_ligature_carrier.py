"""The ligature carrier differs by host, and the class-only anchor must span both (#730).

Flow renders the SAME Material Symbols ligature under different tags depending on which
frontend serves the account:

* ``labs.google``           → ``<i class="google-symbols">arrow_forward</i>``
* ``flow.google.com``       → ``<mat-icon class="… google-symbols …">arrow_forward</mat-icon>``

A selector anchored on ``i.google-symbols`` therefore matches **zero** on the migrated host
while the control is fully visible — measured 2026-09-07 on `denon82`, every ligature, both
surfaces (``docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-09-07-ligature-carrier-and-name-drift.md``). That
split shipped twice: #727 (`--format-prompt` a silent no-op) and #731 (published docs
asserting stale selectors as VERIFIED).

The fix rests on one claim: **the `google-symbols` class sits on both carriers, so a
class-only anchor covers both hosts.** On the live migrated host that was observed —
`.google-symbols` counted identically to `mat-icon`, every time. On **labs it was never
observed**: no unmoved account exists here, so the `<i>` half is CSS semantics, asserted.

This file settles it with a real CSS engine and no account, no network and no credits:
a two-carrier fixture, headless Chromium, one `count()`. If the assertion below ever fails,
the premise of #730 is wrong and the class-only anchors must be reverted to explicit
per-carrier cascades.

Deliberately a *precondition*, not a mock: a `MagicMock` page would happily agree with
whatever the author believed, which is precisely how an unverified selector claim reaches
production. Only a browser can answer whether a selector resolves.
