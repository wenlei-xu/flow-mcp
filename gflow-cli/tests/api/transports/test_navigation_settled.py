"""Every Flow navigation settles before the next action (issues #580, #584).

`page.goto(wait_until="domcontentloaded")` returns BEFORE Flow's locale redirect
lands — measured 591-797 ms with the redirect after. Whatever runs next operates
on a page about to be navigated away: overlay clicks land on a leaving page, and
`page.evaluate` raises "Execution context was destroyed".

#580 settled three sites. An audit found four more, including
`evaluate_fetch.refresh_auth` — an auth path that reported success while the page
was still moving.

This test is a ratchet: it fails when a NEW unsettled navigation appears, so the
audit does not have to be redone by hand.
