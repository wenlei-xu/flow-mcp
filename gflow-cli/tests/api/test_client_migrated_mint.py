"""#673 — the labs client must not mint a reCAPTCHA token on the migrated host.

On a moved account the pool's bootstrap page is ``flow.google.com/`` (the project
grid), which carries no ``recaptcha/enterprise.js``. ``_mint_recaptcha_token`` ran
before the transport's migration guards could, so ``discover_site_key`` raised a
bare ``RecaptchaError`` (exit 1, "unexpected") instead of the distinct exit 36.
