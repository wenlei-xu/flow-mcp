"""Live proof that the MCP character tools agree with the CLI (#689).

AGENTS.md § "MCP parity is not a chore, it is the contract" says a twin is a separate
surface, so verifying the CLI does not verify MCP. This drives **both** against the same
live project and asserts they return the same entities.

That is the assertion that matters here, because the exemption these tools replaced
recorded exactly how a previous attempt failed: "the old MCP stub returned a misleading
empty list (#499)". An empty list is indistinguishable from a project with no characters,
so an agent silently concludes there is nothing to attach. Offline tests cannot catch
that -- a stub returning `[]` passes them all.

Opt-in: ``-m e2e_auth`` with ``GFLOW_CLI_E2E_PROFILE`` and
``GFLOW_CLI_E2E_CHARACTER_PROJECT`` set. Read-only; spends nothing.
