"""E2E: an account short of credits reports exit 37, never selector drift (23).

Flow does not disable the submit control when an account cannot afford the model — it
**replaces** it. ``arrow_forward`` disappears and a ``prompt-warning-button`` carrying
``aria-label='Insufficient credits warning'`` takes its place, so the anchor's absence
tracks the wallet and not the frontend. Reported as ``UiSelectorDriftError`` this told
users *"Google may have updated their frontend … file a bug"* over a credit shortfall,
which also manufactures frontend-drift reports no code change can fix.

**Short of credits, not necessarily out of them.** Veo tiers cost different amounts, so
the threshold is per-model: measured 2026-09-07, ``ci-probe`` held **50** credits and
still rendered the warning. Flow's own aria-label says *insufficient*, not *none*.

The unit half of this lives in ``tests/api/transports/test_migrated_composer.py`` and
proves the branch. It cannot prove that Flow still renders that warning, or that our
selector still matches it — only a live account whose balance is short for the model
can, which is what this is for::

    GFLOW_CLI_E2E_DRAINED_PROFILE=<profile that cannot afford the model> \\
    GFLOW_CLI_E2E_DRAINED_PROJECT=<project-uuid on that account> \\
        uv run pytest -m e2e tests/e2e/test_insufficient_credits_e2e.py -v

**Cost: zero, and structurally so.** Flow refuses before any submit, so nothing is
ordered and nothing is billed. That is why this carries ``e2e_auth`` rather than
``e2e_video``.

Deliberately gated on its own env vars rather than ``GFLOW_CLI_E2E_PROFILE``: the normal
e2e profile is a FUNDED one (the rest of the suite needs it to be), and pointing this at
a funded account would silently pass by never reaching the branch — a green that proves
nothing, which is the failure mode this whole change exists to remove.
