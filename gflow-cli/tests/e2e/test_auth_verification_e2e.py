"""E2E tests for the issue-#15 Flow-session verification feature.

These probe the REAL Google `/api/auth/session` endpoint via
`verify_flow_profile`, and (positive case) confirm a verified profile is
actually usable by `FlowApiClient`. Opt-in: `-m e2e` + `GFLOW_CLI_E2E_PROFILE`.
Zero Flow credits are spent - no image generation.

Async tests need no `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator: `asyncio_mode = "auto"`
is set in pyproject.toml.

See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-17-e2e-test-coverage-design.md.
