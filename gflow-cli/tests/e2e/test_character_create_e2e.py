"""Live E2E for ``gflow character create`` / ``gflow character show`` (issue #145, Phase-2 Task 12).

These tests CODIFY the formal Definition-of-Done for the Character-creation
feature. The live happy path was first verified MANUALLY on 2026-06-02 against
the ``denon82`` profile — entity ``951d2ce4`` ("Marina Côrtes") was created
end-to-end (face image-gen bound to the entity, entity patched, read-back
confirmed in the existing project). The tests below make that manual proof
*repeatable* so the feature stays covered.

# Cost & opt-in gates

``character create`` drives real image generation, zero credits (it runs a real face image
generation, optionally a body one). The tests are therefore **default-OFF** so
CI and ``/gflow:check`` never burn credits. Two gates must BOTH be satisfied:

  - ``GFLOW_CLI_E2E_PROFILE``        master gate; Chrome-strategy profile name
                                     (provided by the ``e2e_env`` fixture).
  - ``GFLOW_CLI_E2E_RUN_CHARACTER``  set to ``1`` to actually run these tests.

Env-parameterized (sensible defaults so a bare opt-in works on ``denon82``):

  - ``GFLOW_CLI_E2E_CHARACTER_PROJECT``  Flow project id the character is created
                                          IN (must be an EXISTING project — the
                                          read-back asserts no new project is
                                          spun up). REQUIRED when opted-in.
  - ``GFLOW_CLI_E2E_CHARACTER_LOCALE``   BCP-47 locale; default ``pt``.
  - ``GFLOW_CLI_E2E_CHARACTER_FACE``     face prompt; sensible default below.
  - ``GFLOW_CLI_E2E_CHARACTER_PERSONALITY`` personality notes; default below.

# Spending

  - each ``character create`` = 1 image generation, zero credits (face only; no ``--body-prompt``).
  - the partial-saga test runs ``create`` TWICE with the SAME name; the second
    run must RESUME (idempotent) and NOT create a second entity — so it should
    not double-spend. A true mid-saga kill is a MANUAL exercise; this test
    asserts the resume path observably (one ``character``-mode op row, not two).

Per the project's verification-ledger discipline ([[verification-ledger-5-layer]]):
assert the *observable* binding proof (entity has workflow ids + a thumbnail
media id, read-back lands in the SAME project) rather than re-deriving the
in-code ``parentEntityId == entityId`` invariant.

    The crash IS injected here, by flipping the recorded operation row back to

    image-gen and the entity PATCH leaves behind, and exactly what the resume path keys
    on (``repository.find_incomplete_character`` filters ``status = 'started'``,
    `repository.py:1139`).

    **This test previously asserted something else and could never pass.** Written
    2026-07-06 (v0.25.0), it ran two ordinary, fully-completing creates and asserted the
    second reused the first's entity. A completed run is recorded ``SUCCEEDED``
    (``recorder.record_character_completed``), so ``find_incomplete_character`` never
    matched it, the saga took its ``else`` branch and minted a second entity — every
    time, on every host. The assertion was red by construction for two months and nobody
    saw it, because ``e2e_character`` is opt-in (``GFLOW_CLI_E2E_RUN_CHARACTER=1``) and
    the nightly canary runs only ``e2e_auth``. First observed in the 2026-09-07 sweep.

    Note what is NOT claimed: ``character create`` is **not** idempotent on name. Two
    ordinary creates with the same name legitimately produce two entities — nothing in
    the CLI, the docs or the saga promises otherwise. Resume-after-crash is the
    guarantee; same-name reuse never was.

      - the isolated data layer ends with EXACTLY ONE ``character``-mode
        operation row (the recorder did not insert a second STARTED entity).

    in-editor **Format** button must actually be found, enabled, and clicked.

    `format_character_prompt` is best-effort by design — a missing button logs
    a warning and submits the prompt as typed. That safety net also means a
    selector that silently stops matching would degrade to a no-op flag with a
    green exit code, so the exit code alone proves nothing. The observable
    proof is the ``ui_automation.prompt_formatted`` event, which is emitted
    only after a visible AND enabled button was clicked; the two failure
    telemetry events are asserted absent so a disabled-button skip
    (Flow ships it disabled on an empty box) can't pass as success.

    What this does NOT assert: the *content* of Flow's rewrite. The reshaped
    text lives in Flow's editor, is authored server-side, and is not returned
    to the CLI — the recorded prompt is the one gflow typed. Verifying the

    """Live ``create --voice --personality`` then ``show``: BOTH must survive the round trip.

    **Until this test, ``--voice`` had never been exercised end-to-end.** A repo-wide
    grep for ``--voice`` across ``tests/e2e/`` matched nothing. Every voice test in the
    suite is a unit test of the hardcoded ``VOICES`` constant — list length,
    capitalisation, the sample-URL string pattern, dataclass frozen-ness — and not one
    reaches Flow. The single test that *looks* live (``chars[0].voice == "gacrux"``)
    parses a fixture. So a voice that silently failed to attach was invisible to the
    entire suite while ``character create`` exited 0, and the sibling test that covers
    the parent-entity binding stops one field short of the voice.

    Personality is asserted **hard** here on purpose. ``test_character_personality_utf8``
    guards it as ``if shown_personality:`` — a soft check that passes vacuously when the
    read-back omits the field entirely, which is precisely the failure worth catching.

    **Voice case is compared case-INSENSITIVELY, deliberately.** The wire case of
    ``presetVoiceId`` is unverified and the repo's own two documents disagree:
    ``docs/CHARACTER.md`` calls the Capitalized UI name canonical (and flags the
    question UNVERIFIED in the same section), while ``docs/CHARACTER_RECON.md`` records
    ``presetVoiceId: "gacrux"`` from a live capture and states the preset id is the
    lowercased name. gflow normalises to Capitalized and sends that. Pinning either
    spelling would make this red for a reason that is not the defect it exists to catch
    — the defect is a voice that does not attach AT ALL. The spelling Flow actually
    returned is reported in the assertion message so a single run settles the
    contradiction with evidence instead of another opinion.
