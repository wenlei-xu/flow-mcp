"""Live BENCHMARK of incident-bundle diagnostic QUALITY against real Flow.

The live spike proves bundles capture; the offline suite proves mechanics.
This gate proves the thing that actually matters for a diagnostics feature:
that a triager who wasn't there can answer the design's five questions from
the bundle alone (spec §2), on data captured from a REAL Flow session — not a
synthetic fixture. It grades two real bundle classes (a UI-state failure and a
metadata-only profile-lock contention) and asserts hard quality FLOORS, so a
regression that quietly hollows out the evidence (empty journals, hosts all
collapsed to ``other``, a null command, a leaked identifier) fails CI here even
though the artifacts still exist.

Zero credits — drives the editor + a contention probe, never a generation.
Opt in: ``-m e2e`` (or ``-m e2e_auth``) with ``GFLOW_CLI_E2E_PROFILE`` set.

The scorer is ``scripts/dev/incident_bundle_quality.py``, also runnable
standalone on any field bundle a user emails.
