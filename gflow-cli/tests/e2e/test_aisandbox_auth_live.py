"""E2E smoke for the L0 aisandbox Bearer-auth fix (Issue #15).

A REST ``uploadImage`` previously returned HTTP 401 to ``page.request``; with
the ``Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`` header attached by ``_post_json``
(token fetched from ``GET /fx/api/auth/session``) it must now succeed.
**Credit-free** — uploading an image asset spends no generation credit. This is
the empirical confirmation the redacted HARs could not give.

Opt-in: ``-m e2e_auth`` + ``GFLOW_CLI_E2E_PROFILE=<logged-in profile>``. The
test opts out of the autouse ``_isolate_settings`` home-redirect so the REAL
profile resolves (keeping a throwaway DB), then resolves the profile inline.
``asyncio_mode=auto`` is set in pyproject.toml, so no ``@pytest.mark.asyncio``.

If this still 401s: the SAPISIDHASH origin or the cookie host filter is wrong.
Re-run with ``GFLOW_CLI_LOG_REQUEST_HEADERS=1`` and diff the (redacted-safe)
header set against a browser DevTools "Copy as cURL" of a working uploadImage.
Do NOT proceed to L1 until this is green.
