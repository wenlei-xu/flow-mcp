"""E2E for attributable click timeouts on the migrated composer (#776).

Binds ``tests/features/click_attribution.feature``. The Gherkin's ``@e2e`` tags become
pytest markers via pytest-bdd, so ``-m e2e`` / ``-m e2e_auth`` select this file exactly
like a hand-written e2e — see ``docs/E2E_TESTING.md`` § BDD-bound e2e.

**Why an e2e and not a unit test.** What fails in #776 is Playwright's *actionability*
gate — attached → visible → stable → receives-events → enabled. A mocked ``Page`` whose
``.click()`` is a stub cannot express "visible, enabled, and still not clickable"; it
would pass against a fix that reads the DOM at the wrong moment, which is the trap #639
set one surface over. Only a real browser can falsify this.

Each scenario therefore breaks a **different** actionability condition, in the browser,
for real:

- covered by a stacked element   → *receives-events*
- an infinite CSS transform      → *stable* (visible, enabled and hit-testable throughout)
- a pressed agent-mode chip      → #752 finding #7's predicted cause, which touches
  neither ``body{pointer-events}`` nor the hit-test

**Cost: zero.** Every Flow origin is served by Playwright route interception, so nothing
reaches Google, no credit is spent and no authenticated profile is needed — the same
harness as ``test_landing_state_diagnosis_bdd.py``.
