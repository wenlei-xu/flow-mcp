"""Opt-in live e2e for ``gflow video chain`` — last-frame I2V chaining.

Hits the **real Google Flow API** and therefore:
  - Is NOT collected by default ``pytest`` runs (gated behind ``e2e`` +
    ``e2e_video``). It NEVER runs in normal CI and spends NO credits unless you
    explicitly opt in.
  - Opt-in: ``GFLOW_CLI_E2E_PROFILE=<profile_name> pytest -m e2e_video``.
  - Requires a logged-in Chrome profile (Pro/Ultra account) AND the ``chain``
    optional extra (PyAV) for the last-frame extractor:
    ``pip install 'gflow-cli[chain]'``.
  - **Submits one pending Veo video operation per link, which may consume
    credits.** This test uses a 2-link manifest (2 operations per run); current
    credit use varies by model, duration, account tier, and Flow policy — check
    Google Flow. Do NOT run in CI without gating.

Criterion covered:
  CHAIN-E2E-1 — ``run_chain`` over a 2-link manifest (link 0 = T2V, link 1 = I2V
    seeded by link 0's extracted last frame) returns one ``ChainLinkResult`` per
    link, each pointing at an mp4 that exists on disk, and the seeded link's
    generate request is observed routing to the Start-image endpoint (NOT the
    text-only endpoint). The route invariant is asserted via the
    ``ui_automation_video.frame_attached`` structlog event, which fires only when
    a start frame is bound through the editor's media dialog — i.e. the i2v link
    actually fired ``...StartImage`` and not ``...Text`` (issue #125). The chain
    aborts loudly (``WireFormatError``) if a seeded link is misrouted to T2V, so
    a successful return is itself partial proof of the route; the explicit event
    assertion guards against a false positive where a clip comes back text-only.
