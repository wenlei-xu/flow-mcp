"""Live e2e for `gflow image batch`. Spends Flow credits. Skipped by
default; opt in by setting GFLOW_CLI_E2E_PROFILE (the canonical e2e gate).

Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-22-stay-mounted-batch-session-design.md §8.3.

Env vars (all GFLOW_CLI_E2E_BATCH_*):
  - GFLOW_CLI_E2E_PROFILE             master gate; Chrome-strategy profile name
  - GFLOW_CLI_E2E_BATCH_MANIFEST      default: test_assets/sample_batch.tsv
  - GFLOW_CLI_E2E_BATCH_JITTER        "0" or "1"; default "1". When "0",
                                       passes jitter_range=(0,0) via DI.

Output: pytest's tmp_path (auto-cleaned). No hand-rolled timestamp dir.
