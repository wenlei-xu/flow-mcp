"""E2E for the post-migration account-chooser autoselect path (#763).

**Why this is an e2e and not one more unit test.** The defect this file pins
shipped through a fully green unit suite: the suite mocked ``page.wait_for_url``
as returning a URL string, so ``(await page.wait_for_url(...) or "")`` looked
like it could be truthy. Playwright's ``wait_for_url`` is annotated ``-> None``
and signals a miss by *raising*, so the mock encoded a contract the real API does
not have, and the inverted check beneath it — which made every *successful*
chooser click raise — was invisible to every assertion. A mock cannot falsify a
belief about the mocked thing. Only a real ``Page`` can.

So these tests drive a **real Playwright page** through the real locator engine,
a real click, a real navigation and the real ``wait_for_url``.

**Cost: zero.** Both the chooser and the Flow landing are served by Playwright
route interception, so no request reaches Google, no Flow credit is spent, and
no authenticated profile is required — see
``docs/superpowers/memory/credit-free-route-abort-verification.md``. That also
makes the test deterministic: the real Google chooser cannot be staged on demand.

The DOM here is a stand-in for Google's markup, so this proves the *mechanism*
(guard → locate → click → land), not that ``[data-email]`` is still the live
chooser's anchor. Selector drift on the real page is a separate question, and
``/gflow:live-verify`` on a signed-out account is what answers it.
