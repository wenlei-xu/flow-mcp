"""Shared fixtures for the e2e test suite.

e2e tests hit the real Flow API / real Google auth endpoints and are opt-in:
run with ``-m e2e`` and ``GFLOW_CLI_E2E_PROFILE=<profile_name>`` set.

## Cost sub-markers

Every e2e test carries ``pytest.mark.e2e`` plus one or more cost sub-markers
so you can run only what you can afford:

    pytest -m "e2e_auth"                         # zero credits
    pytest -m "e2e and not e2e_batch and not e2e_video"  # cheap
    pytest -m "e2e"                              # full regression

| marker     | cost             | typical wallclock |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| e2e_auth   | 0 credits        | < 30 s            |
| e2e_image  | 0 (daily cap)    | 30–120 s          |
| e2e_batch  | 0 (daily cap)    | 2–10 min          |
| e2e_video  | 1 Veo credit     | 1–10 min          |
| e2e_data   | same as above *  | +0 s              |

``e2e_data`` is always combined with ``e2e_image`` or ``e2e_video`` because
data-layer assertions depend on a real generation having run.

See docs/E2E_TESTING.md for the full layer reference.
