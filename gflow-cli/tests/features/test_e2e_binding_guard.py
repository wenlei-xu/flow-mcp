"""Guard: `@e2e`-tagged Gherkin and the e2e suite must agree about each other.

The Bug Lane (`skills/issue-resolve/SKILL.md`) says a scenario on a Flow/UI
surface is formalised as an **e2e** test, and the binding is carried by a
Gherkin tag: pytest-bdd converts `@e2e @e2e_auth` into `pytest.mark.e2e` /
`pytest.mark.e2e_auth`, which is what `addopts`' `-m 'not e2e ...'` filters on.

Three ways that binding silently breaks, all caught here without a browser:

1. **Orphan scenario** — Gherkin written, e2e test never was. The lane's whole
   failure mode ("recorded, not omitted"), invisible to every other gate.
2. **No cost sub-marker** — `-m e2e_auth` cannot select it, so it only ever runs
   in a full `-m e2e` sweep and the nightly canary never sees it.
3. **Untagged live binding** — a feature bound from ``tests/e2e/`` but *not*
   tagged carries no `e2e` marker, so `addopts` does not exclude it and hosted
   CI runs it: Chrome launch, no profile, red for a reason nobody can read.
4. **Double binding** — one feature bound from BOTH directories runs every
   scenario twice. This is the rule `docs/E2E_TESTING.md` states and, until the
   council pointed it out, the only one nothing enforced (D12).

Static text checks only. Proving these tests **pass** is a different job, done
on a machine with a warm profile (`scripts/canary/`), never in hosted CI.
