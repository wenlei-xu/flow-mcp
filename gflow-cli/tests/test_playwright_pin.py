"""The playwright dependency must stay upper-bounded, and the constants the
transport shows users must stay in step with it.

Why this is worth a test: playwright is not an ordinary dependency here — it
ships the browser driver, and every gflow generation is automation through it,
so an untested playwright minor is an untested product. On 2026-08-03 an
install that resolved 1.62.0 against a project locked to 1.59.0 made every
`gflow video i2v` run hang SILENTLY right after the frame upload (browser
alive, no error, no timeout). `uv tool install <path>` ignores `uv.lock`, so
the pyproject range is the only thing standing between a user and an untested
driver. A future edit that relaxes the bound would silently re-open that.
