# Live Verification — v0.27.0

Release date: 2026-07-07. Headline: **global `[style]` block with named variants
in `movie.toml`** (Issue #239, PR #259) — express a visual style arc once
(prefix/suffix + `[style.variants.*]`) and select it per-scene via
`style_variant` / `style_suffix` — plus **prompt-aware resume** for `movie run`
(completed scenes persist a `style_hash`; a scene whose composed prompt changed
is regenerated instead of silently skipped).

Verification run: 2026-07-07, real CLI (`gflow movie run --dry-run`), Windows,
`.venv` build of the release tree. **Deliberately credit-free**: this release is
pure local prompt composition + state logic — the Flow wire path (transports,
selectors, auth) is untouched, so no live Veo generation was spent. The dry-run
path exercises the identical manifest→parse→compose→resume-decision pipeline the
live run uses; only `_generate_scene` (unchanged this release) is skipped.

## Scope

| Change | Surface | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `[style]` prefix/suffix + `[style.variants.*]`, per-scene `style_variant`/`style_suffix` | `composition.py`, `movie_manifest.py` | ✅ CLI dry-run + 91 unit/integration tests |
| Prompt-aware resume (`style_hash`, `is_stale_for`, re-run on style edit) | `movie_manifest.py`, `cli_movie.py` | ✅ CLI dry-run 3-way ledger (below) |
| Dry-run shows resolved style + stale marker | `cli_movie.py` | ✅ CLI dry-run output |
| `style_applied` (variant/prefix/suffix/scene_suffix) per clip + schema | `composition.py`, `docs/schemas/movie-handoff.schema.json` | ✅ Unit-tested (jsonschema validation) |
| Reserved `none` variant name, strict variant parsing | `movie_manifest.py` | ✅ Unit-tested (ConfigurationError paths) |

## Evidence ledger (credit-free CLI runs)

Manifest: 3 scenes — `s1-base` (base style), `s2-warm` (`style_variant="warm"` +
`style_suffix="golden hour light"`), `s3-optout` (`style_variant="none"`), with
`prefix = "SCENE:"` and a base suffix.

1. **Composed prompt (canonical order)** — `compose_prompt` for `s1-base`
   produced exactly:
   `SCENE: Walks through a rainy plaza. Wide shot. Black and white cinematic
   street photography, film grain.` — prefix first, sentence-composed
   action/framing, raw base suffix last.
2. **Run 1 (fresh state)** — plan shows the resolved style per scene and full
   cost: `s1-base … style=base 1 credit(s)`, `s2-warm … style=warm
   +style_suffix 1 credit(s)`, `s3-optout … style=none 1 credit(s)`,
   `Estimated credits: ~3`.
3. **Run 2 (s1 completed in `movie-state.json` with matching `style_hash`)** —
   `s1-base … skip (done)`, `Estimated credits: ~2`. State file JSON carries
   `"style_hash": "<sha256 of the composed prompt>"` (round-tripped via
   `MovieState.save`/`load`).
4. **Run 3 (base suffix edited to "Sepia archival newsreel look.")** —
   `s1-base … re-run (style changed) 1 credit(s)`, `Estimated credits: ~3`.
   The stale scene is regenerated; the unchanged `s2-warm`/`s3-optout`
   decisions are unaffected. This is the exact staleness bug the feature
   exists to prevent (stale clip silently skipped after a style edit).
5. **User-confirmable artifact** — the three plan outputs above are
   reproducible with any manifest; the same decision logic drives the real run
   loop (`_run_movie` calls the identical `is_stale_for` check before spending
   credits).

### Not live-verified this cycle (recorded, not omitted)

Actual Veo generation with a style-suffixed prompt (i.e. confirming Flow's
model renders the requested grade) was **not** exercised — it costs 20 credits
per scene and the prompt text demonstrably reaches the existing, unchanged
generation path (`_run_one_scene` passes the same `compose_prompt` output that
v0.26.0 passed). First credited `movie run` on a styled manifest will confirm
visually; no code path is untested locally.

### Pre-existing display nit (not this release)

The plan line's `[t2v]`/`[r2v]` mode tag is swallowed by rich markup
(`console.print` interprets `[t2v]` as a style tag) — present on `develop`
before PR #259; cosmetic; tracked as a follow-up.

## Post-tag evidence

- Signed tag `v0.27.0` pushed 2026-07-07; `Release` workflow green
  (build-and-publish 37s, digital attestations generated).
- GitHub Release **v0.27.0** published 2026-07-07T21:16:40Z (not draft).
- PyPI: `gflow-cli 0.27.0` live — `gflow_cli-0.27.0-py3-none-any.whl` +
  `gflow_cli-0.27.0.tar.gz` (verified via the PyPI JSON API).
- Release PR #260 (`chore/release-v0.27.0 → main`) merged with a merge commit
  after a fully green matrix + SonarCloud gate; branch deleted.
- `main` back-merged into `develop` (`2909cb6`) — branches aligned.

## Automated coverage

- 59 style-variants tests across `tests/composition/test_style_variants.py`,
  `test_style_variants_e2e.py`, `tests/cli/test_movie_manifest_style_variants.py`
  (composition order, variant resolution, reserved `none`, strict parsing,
  `style_applied` + jsonschema validation, `resume_hash` properties,
  `is_stale_for` all four branches, state round-trip).
- Full suite green: 2054 passed, 7 skipped (local) and 3.11/3.12/3.13 matrix +
  SonarCloud quality gate green on PR #259. `pyright src` 0 errors, ruff clean.
