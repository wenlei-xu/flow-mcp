# Selector Registry + Drift Probe Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Turn gflow's scattered Flow DOM selectors into a structured, enumerable registry that a $0 CI probe walks nightly, so drift is *named* rather than inferred from a failing test.

**Architecture:** A pure-data registry (`Surface` + `Selector`) and a pure grader, driven by one CI probe: navigate at a pinned viewport, detect the UI arm with production's own detector, read the DOM once, grade.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.11+, Playwright (already a dep), pytest, ruff, GitHub Actions.

**Spec:** [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-21-selector-registry-design.md`](../specs/2026-08-21-selector-registry-design.md)

## Global Constraints

- **Windows dev:** `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest`, never `uv run pytest` (broken here). Never pipe pytest to `tail` — it masks the exit code.
- **$0 invariant:** reach steps MUST be non-mutating and credit-free. Never submit.
- **Pin the viewport to 1920×1080.** `ui_automation.py:117-124`: smaller *"would cross the responsive breakpoint and drift the selectors"*. `FlowApiClient` (1280×720) and Playwright's default (1280×720) are both **below** it.
- **`observed_mode` is REQUIRED by the grader**, and must come from production's own detector: `factory._any_present(page, _CLASSIC_CROP_SELECTORS)` over **all six** ratio variants. Checking only `candidates[0]` is a silent-pass hole — a classic editor on a 9:16 project reads AGENTIC, so a drifted `crop_control` grades EXPECTED_ABSENT and hides permanently.
- **A stale project renders an error shell** (~441KB, 3 buttons, 0 icons) indistinguishable from an auth wall. The probe must therefore be able to say *"the surface did not load"* (exit 2) rather than *"a selector drifted"* (exit 1). It does **not** create projects — that would be a mutating operation against the $0 invariant.
- **No default-suite test may launch a real browser.** `ci.yml:165` runs plain pytest and **no workflow installs Playwright**. Browser-touching tests live in the probe workflow, which installs chromium itself.
- **Secrets:** `__Secure-next-auth.session-token` only, from a dedicated throwaway account. Never log a cookie value. For any published output reuse `src/gflow_cli/data/redaction.py` — it already covers `Bearer`, `SAPISIDHASH`, `__Secure-next-auth.session-token` and signed queries.
- **Package name:** `gflow_cli.flow_selectors`, NOT `gflow_cli.ui` — `src/gflow_cli/ui/` already means gflow's own UI (`app.py`, `server.py`).

### Task 1: Registry model, grader, and entries

**Files:**
- Create: `src/gflow_cli/flow_selectors/__init__.py`, `model.py`, `grading.py`, `registry.py`
- Test: `tests/flow_selectors/__init__.py`, `test_model.py`, `test_grading.py`, `test_registry.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `gflow_cli.config.UiMode`; the existing constants in `mode_control` / `ui_automation`.
- Produces: `Surface`, `Selector`, `Grade`, `Outcome`, `grade(...)`, `SURFACES`, `SELECTORS`, `for_surface()`.

### Task 2: CI probe

**Files:**
- Create: `scripts/probe/run_probe.py`
- Create: `.github/workflows/selector-probe.yml`
- Test: `tests/flow_selectors/test_report.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `registry`, `grade`, `Outcome`.
- Produces: `render_report(outcomes) -> str`; `async resolve(page, entries, mode) -> list[Outcome]`.

> **No `check_html` / no static re-parse.** An earlier draft closed the live page,
> launched a *second* chromium and re-parsed `page.content()` through
> `set_content()` — which drops external CSS/JS and shadow roots, making it
> strictly lower fidelity than the live page it had just discarded. It was
> residue from the cut snapshot layer. Resolve against the live `page`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the report tests**

Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/flow_selectors/test_report.py -v`
Expected: PASS (5 tests)

- [ ] **Step 5: Add the workflow**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/selector-probe.yml
name: Selector drift probe

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 5 * * *"
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  probe:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.repository == 'ffroliva/gflow-cli'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with: { persist-credentials: false }
      - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v7
      - run: uv sync --frozen
      - run: uv run playwright install chromium --with-deps
      - name: Probe
        env:
          GFLOW_CI_SESSION_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GFLOW_CI_SESSION_TOKEN }}
          GFLOW_CI_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.GFLOW_CI_PROJECT_ID }}
        run: uv run python scripts/probe/run_probe.py --surface editor
```

**Never add `pull_request`.** Fork PRs are safe (GitHub withholds secrets), but
**same-repo branch PRs do receive them** while checking out attacker-editable probe
code. Never use `pull_request_target`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Full gate and commit**

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m ruff check src tests
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m ruff format --check src tests
.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/ci/check_repo_hygiene.py
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/flow_selectors tests/scripts -v
git add scripts/probe/run_probe.py .github/workflows/selector-probe.yml tests/flow_selectors/test_report.py
git commit -m "feat(probe): CI selector-drift probe on a single session cookie

Exit 2 (infrastructure) stays distinct from exit 1 (drift): an expired token or
a deleted project must never be published as Google changing the page.

schedule + workflow_dispatch only. pull_request would hand the secret to
same-repo branch PRs alongside attacker-editable probe code."
```

## First run checklist (R1)

1. Create the throwaway account, sign in once, capture its session token.
2. `gh secret set GFLOW_CI_SESSION_TOKEN` and `GFLOW_CI_PROJECT_ID`.
3. `workflow_dispatch` once. **Datacenter-IP behaviour is unmeasured** — all evidence is from a residential IP.
4. **Re-run on day 7.** §2.2 establishes the cookie only at mint time; an aged token is unverified, and §2.7 says it hard-dies at day 30 with no rotation and therefore no warning.

## Deferred to a follow-up plan

- **AST guardrail.** It flags **9 real offenders today** (`ui_automation_video.py:91-96,162`, `agentic.py:62`, `diagnostics.py:1738`), so it reds on arrival while its own migration is deferred.
- **`selector_key` on `UiSelectorDriftError`** — needs the drivers to read from the registry (all 7 raise sites are in `ui_automation*`), and `GFlowError.__init__` takes a fixed kwarg list, so it is not a one-line addition. Lands with the import inversion.
- **`GFLOW_CLI_SELECTOR_OVERRIDE` is NOT deferred — it is rejected.** See spec §3.5: an env var injecting arbitrary DOM selectors into production automation is a hack, and the probe already delivers the half that matters by reporting drift by key.
- Remaining ~35 selectors, inverting the import direction, `Reach` for state-gated surfaces, additional surfaces.
