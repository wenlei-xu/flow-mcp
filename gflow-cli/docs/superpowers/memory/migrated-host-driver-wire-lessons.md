description: "What the flow.google.com (migrated) driver builds got wrong and how each was pinned — poster vs mp4 URL slots, status-3-before-URL, labs redirect route 404s for migrated media ids, CSS :text-matches escaping, direct load works for unflagged accounts; plus the i2v slice-1 frame-attach lessons (late picker index, no media id in DOM, empty Frames submit goes out as t2v) and the r2v slice-2 lessons (references are @ mentions not chips, MZZa6b submit rpc, mode-less t2v model key, and a body assertion whose listener was never registered)"

Built and live-verified 2026-09-05 (`docs/LIVE_VERIFICATION_v0.67.0.md`, recon
`docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-09-05-migrated-host-wire-protocol.md`). Each of these
cost a real run to learn; each is now a unit test in `tests/api/transports/`.

- **Record slots:** in the shared `YhhmEf`/`jwpduf`/`as29s` record, `DETAILS[10]` is the
  **poster JPEG** signed URL and `MEDIA_INFO[0][8]` is the **mp4** — the first build
  had them swapped and downloaded a 37 KB JPEG named `.mp4`. `download()` now checks
  `ftyp` at offset 4 and falls back to the other URL; never trust the slot alone.
- **Status 3 arrives before the URL:** the app's `jwpduf` poll reports 3 first; the
  record with the signed URLs (`as29s`) follows 2–8 s later. Treating the first 3 as
  terminal loses the URL — wait a grace (20 s) for the URL-carrying record.
- **Labs redirect route is dead for migrated media:** `media.getMediaUrlRedirect?name=<id>`
  answers **404** for a migrated media id — the signed CDN URL (`flow-content.google`,
  `KeyName=labs-flow-prod-cdn-key`) is the download path; the host is in the allowlist.
- **`:text-matches('^\s*8s\s*$')` is silently wrong:** Playwright's CSS string escaping
  turns `\s` into `s`. Use `locator.filter(has_text=re.compile(...))`; ligature anchors
  (`mat-icon:text-is('videocam')`) carry no backslash and are fine.
- **Composer is the `contenteditable`,** the sibling `textarea` times out on click.
- **Direct load works for everyone:** `https://flow.google.com/project/<id>` served the
  Angular editor to the UNFLAGGED `denon82` (pt) account too — the new host IS the
  default (since #664's round-7 commit) for every request it can serve — t2v with a project —
  on moved and unmoved accounts alike under `auto`; `flow.google.com` forces everything,
  `labs.google` is the kill switch. denon82 itself moved on 2026-09-05.
- **The settings pane is not `.cdk-overlay-pane.last`** (#665): after the model menu — a second
  overlay — opens and closes, a detached menu pane can still be the LAST overlay, so every axis
  after `--model` read "0 option groups". Resolve the pane as the overlay that CONTAINS a
  `[role='radiogroup']`; the fake page keeps a stale menu pane as `.last` so the regression
  cannot pass vacuously. Found by the $0 #650 check, not by any test.
- **Dispatch timing:** on a flagged account the bootstrap page has already hopped when
  `_generate_video_locked` starts (`migrated.dispatch` at ~6.8 s), so the composer is
  chosen BEFORE any labs project entry; the after-entry check exists for the case where
  the hop lands during project navigation.
- **Submit-enable race after `insert_text`** (#670, PR #672): Angular flips the
  `arrow_forward` button from `disabled` ~100 ms AFTER `keyboard.insert_text` lands (measured
  107 ms; `keyboard.type` never shows it). A synchronous `is_enabled()` read straight after
  typing gets the stale state and raised exit 23 on every run for a slow account, while the
  maintainer accounts submitted at ~200 ms and never saw it — a green release ledger is not
  proof the race is absent. `submit_and_observe` now polls up to 5 s at 100 ms; a button that
  never enables is still selector drift ("stayed disabled for 5s"). Note `is_enabled()` with no
  `timeout=` retry-polls until the locator resolves (Playwright 1.61 `_callOnElementOnceMatches`),
  so a button that detaches mid-loop waits out the default timeout — pre-existing, not fixed.
- **Session hook + heredoc apostrophes, reconfirmed:** a bash heredoc whose body carries
  apostrophes in prose fails with "unexpected EOF while looking for matching quote" —
  write edit scripts to a file with the Write tool and run them.
- **i2v (slice 1, 2026-09-05, `docs/LIVE_VERIFICATION_v0.69.0.md`):** the i2v submit is rpc
  **`eb1hJf`** (t2v stays `YhhmEf`); an EMPTY Frames submit goes out on `YhhmEf` with a
  `_t2v_` key — the labs #125 shape — so the submit *request* body is asserted to carry the
  uploaded media id and an `_i2v_` key before the run is trusted. The Frames picker
  (`flow-add-menu-popover-content`) exposes **no media id in its DOM**: uploads are listed
  under their file name, the id comes from the app's own `maseQ` upload reply. **The picker
  search is server-side and a fresh upload is not always indexed on the first query** — on a
  32-asset project two runs missed it within 8 s and a third listed it, so the composer
  reopens the popover and re-searches (3 attempts). In the Frames submode this cohort's
  pane renders **no duration row for Veo 3.1 Lite** (#650 shape): forcing `--duration` is a
  $0 exit 11, so i2v runs pass none. The toolbar `+` is found by XPath
  (`//button[.//mat-icon[normalize-space()='add']][not(ancestor::flow-prompt-box)]`) — the
  prompt box carries its own `add` icons and CSS cannot exclude an ancestor.

**The reCAPTCHA mint sits one layer ABOVE the transport (#673, PR #678).**
`FlowApiClient._mint_recaptcha_token` mints on the pool's bootstrap page before
`transport.generate_images` / upscale / extend ever run, so transport-level
`raise_if_migrated` guards never cover it. On a moved account that page is the
`flow.google.com` grid (client-side handoff), which loads no `recaptcha/enterprise.js`,
so `discover_site_key` raised `RecaptchaError` — a `RuntimeError` unmapped in
`EXIT_CODE_MAP` — as exit 1 "unexpected" instead of exit 36. The guard now runs at the
mint too (`client.py`, `at="mint_recaptcha_token"`); `git grep raise_if_migrated` is
the current list of sites. Reviewing anything that adds a pre-transport step: ask
"which page is the pool holding at that moment on a moved account?"

## Frame attach — i2v slice 1 (v0.69.0, #639)

Folded out of `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-05-migrated-i2v/` when that plan shipped.
Evidence: `docs/LIVE_VERIFICATION_v0.69.0.md`; recon
`docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-09-05-migrated-frames-attach.md`.

- **The Start-frame picker exposes no media id in its DOM.** Uploads are listed by *file
  name*, so binding is a name search — not an id lookup. Plan for name collisions rather
  than assuming identity.
- **The picker's search is server-side (`UpteDb`) and indexes a fresh upload late.** On a
  32-asset project both e2e tests missed an upload within 8 s and the identical test passed
  minutes later. The composer reopens the popover and searches up to
  `FRAME_SEARCH_ATTEMPTS = 3` times. **A "not found" against a just-uploaded asset is a
  timing claim, not an absence claim** — the same shape as
  [[reference-menu-panel-shared-trigger]].
- **An empty Frames submit silently goes out as text-to-video** (the labs #125 shape) and
  bills a clip that is not what was asked for. Refuse an unbound chip *before* the click —
  exit 23, zero credits. Never let this one degrade into a warning.
- **Inspect the submit request as it leaves.** i2v is rpc `eb1hJf`, t2v is `YhhmEf`; the
  upload is `maseQ`. A body missing the uploaded media id, or carrying a `_t2v_` model key,
  fails the run — after the fact, since the request is already on the wire, but it names
  what Flow was actually asked to make instead of leaving a wrong clip unexplained.
- **A request built without a model does not merely default — it inherits the editor's
  remembered tier.** Runs built directly left `request.model` as `None`, so the composer
  used whatever the editor last had; a queued MCP request (whose payload also carries no
  model) could have inherited a 100-credit tier. Bind the documented default explicitly, and
  log the *effective* model, not the requested one. Found by review, not by a run.
- **An outer stage timeout smaller than the sum of the waits it wraps converts a
  stage-named failure into a generic timeout.** Bound each leg on its own instead.

## Reference attach — r2v slice 2 (#639)

Recon `docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-09-05-migrated-r2v-attach-surface.md` (405 lines, seven
rounds); e2e `tests/e2e/test_migrated_host_e2e.py`. Read this before re-mining that spike.

- **References are NOT a chip slot on this host — they are `@` mentions in the prompt.**
  Frames bind to `flow-prompt-box button.empty-chip`; a reference becomes a
  `.mention-chip` inside the `contenteditable`, and the chip's `data-reference-type`
  (`media` / `entity` / `likeness`) decides which wire slot carries its id. `entity_id`
  being null does **not** mean nothing attached.
- **The Ingredients submit is rpcid `MZZa6b`** — not `YhhmEf` (t2v) and not `eb1hJf`
  (i2v). Several rounds of recon reported "r2v never submits" purely because only the
  first was being watched. Any new sub-mode: find its rpcid before concluding anything.
- **Enter commits a mention; a typed query alone inserts nothing** and leaves the picker
  open. And mentions need real key events (`keyboard.type`) where prompt text needs
  `insert_text` — the latter dispatches input events with no keystrokes, so the mention
  plugin opens a picker with no query behind it. The two gestures cannot share a path,
  because a newline in prompt text must not submit.
- **Picker name matching is loose:** querying `"me"` matched an avatar named *Me* rather
  than the uploaded `me.jpg`. Query the full filename, then verify chip-by-chip.
- **The r2v model key is mode-specific** (`veo_3_1_r2v_lite_low_priority`), but the t2v
  key it contrasts with carries **no mode infix at all**. A diagnostic regex written as a
  mode alternation therefore says "no model key" for exactly the body it exists to
  describe — a t2v key on an r2v submit, i.e. the picker having inserted nothing.
- **r2v exists only at the base duration (8s), and below it Flow DEGRADES rather than
  refuses.** At 4s/6s the app flattens the mention chips into plain prompt text and
  submits `veo_3_1_t2v_lite_<n>s_low_priority` — a full-price text-to-video clip carrying
  the file *names* and none of the images. The editor remembers the last duration, so a
  run passing none inherits it; the composer pins the base tier best-effort and refuses an
  explicit degrading duration at exit 11. **The media slot carries the ids even in the
  degraded submits**, so "are the ids in the body?" is not a sufficient assertion — the
  model key is. Measured at $0, three route-blocked runs varying only duration.
- **A body assertion is only as good as its listener registration.** `_r2v_body_problem`
  was written, unit-tested and green while `page.on("request", …)` stayed gated on
  `expect_media_id is not None` — never true on the r2v path — so the check could not run
  in a live run. **Assert the round trip: drive the real entry point and check the far end
  observed it.** A unit test on either half of a join passes while the join is broken;
  this is the same shape as #689 (a payload key read but never written) and the MCP r2v
  guard that was stricter than the rule it fronted. Related:
  [[dead-wiring-passes-every-gate]].

## Image submit — the t2i / i2i slice (#639)

- **`ogiZ0b` is synchronous, and that is the one place on this host where a submit
  reply IS the terminal answer.** Video submits (`YhhmEf` / `eb1hJf` / `MZZa6b`) start a
  job and the result arrives later on `jwpduf` / `as29s`; the image submit's own reply
  already carries completed records with signed JPEG URLs and dimensions, and there is
  no polling rpc on that path at all. Note this explicitly whenever the point comes up,
  because the standing rule is the opposite — [[intermediate-signal-is-not-terminal]]
  was written from a null `MZZa6b` reply read as a refusal three times. Images are the
  documented exception, not a counter-example to it.
- **The migrated page owns the image reCAPTCHA.** The labs client minted a token on the
  pool's bootstrap page before the transport ran; on a moved account that page is the
  `flow.google.com` grid, which carries no `enterprise.js`, so the mint failed before
  any guard could classify it (#673). The client now skips minting when the transport
  reports `uses_page_owned_image_recaptcha()` and lets the project page mint + submit.
- **Derive that capability from a latch, not from `page.url`.** The image path parks the
  page on `about:blank` when it finishes, which routes as `labs` — so a URL-derived
  capability answers `False` on the *second* image in one client session and falls back
  to the very mint it exists to avoid. Invisible to every single-image test; reachable
  from `gflow image batch`, which runs every prompt through one `FlowApiClient`. Same
  shape as the r2v listener above: both halves correct, the join stateful and wrong.
- **Enumerate the axis before mapping to it.** The image aspect radiogroup carried four
  radios — `crop_16_9`, `crop_landscape`, `crop_square`, `crop_9_16` — and no
  `crop_portrait`. A driver that maps 3:4 to a guessed ligature does not fail as "not
  ported"; it misses its selector and raises `UiSelectorDriftError` (exit 23), which
  tells the user to file a frontend bug about a frontend that is fine. Refuse an
  unmeasured axis value as an unported form (exit 36) and keep the measured set in its
  own constant, so the difference between *observed* and *assumed* survives in code.
