# Selector Registry + Drift Probe — Design

**Status:** Draft, council round 1 applied (5 dimensions, all YELLOW)
**Date:** 2026-08-21
**Related:** #502 (nightly canary, shipped), #404, #493, #174, #299, #313, #171

---

## 1. Problem

gflow drives Flow by locating DOM elements. Those locators — **selectors** — are the
project's #1 breakage class: Google changes the page without notice and gflow stops
working. Every incident below is a selector that moved:

| Incident | What Google did |
|---|---|
| #404 | renamed video count tabs `1x` → `x1` |
| #493 | expanded sidebar removed the classic composer |
| #174 | library UI A/B flip |
| #313 | agent settings panel became sticky |

**No inventory.** Selectors are scattered across four modules, some inline, some
module-private ~2,900 lines into a 3,557-line file:

```
mode_control.py:43,49,61,79        factory.py:52,58,60
agentic.py:62,210                  (inline literals)
ui_automation.py:97…460, 2924, 2952, 2961, 2964
ui_automation_video.py:90,103,144
```

Nobody — human or agent — can answer *"what parts of Flow's page does gflow depend on?"*
The nightly canary (#502) can therefore only report *"a test failed"*, never *"this
selector moved"*.

**Context lives in file paths, not data.** `SIDEBAR_CLOSE_SELECTOR` and
`SIDEBAR_CLOSE_FALLBACK_SELECTOR` are related only by naming convention.
`UiSelectorDriftError` carries "the probe label" as free text. None of it is queryable.

---

## 2. Evidence

Measurements taken 2026-08-21. Independently replicated during council review; the
replication is recorded here because two claims changed as a result.

### 2.1 Offline selector checking works

Playwright's `set_content()` plus its locator engines (`:has()`, `:text-is()`) resolve
gflow's real selectors against static HTML — no network, auth, or credits.

### 2.2 One cookie is sufficient — *at mint time*

Six-arm matrix, positive control in-run, one variable at a time — **plus the negative
control the first write-up lacked**. Reproduce with `scripts/probe/spike_auth_matrix.py`.

| Arm | Browser | Cookie | project | composer | icons | buttons |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CONTROL | real Chrome + full profile | profile (63) | real | 1 | 17 | — |
| D | real Chrome, fresh ctx | labs.google (7) | real | 1 | 17 | — |
| E | real Chrome, fresh ctx | all 63 | real | 1 | 17 | — |
| F | bundled chromium | all 63 | real | 1 | 17 | — |
| G | bundled chromium | labs.google (7) | real | 1 | 17 | — |
| **H** | **bundled chromium** | **session-token only** | real | **1** | 17 | — |
| **N1** | bundled chromium | **none** | real | **0** | 9 | 67 |
| **N3** | bundled chromium | **value replaced with `xxx…`** | real | **0** | 9 | 67 |
| N2 | bundled chromium | valid | **bogus** | 0 | **0** | **3** |

`__Secure-next-auth.session-token` (1088 chars, scoped to `labs.google`) is sufficient
alone. **N1/N3 are what make this falsifiable**: without the cookie, or with its value
corrupted, the app does not render. The cookie's *value* does the work, not its presence.

The discriminator is **`composer ≥ 1` and `icons ≫ 0`**, not the literal cell values —
those drift run to run (icons 17→18, jar 63→65).

This is decisive because the blocker assumed for CI auth — `__Secure-1PSIDTS` rotating
every ~10 minutes — is a **Google** cookie. Flow does not authenticate on it.

**Scope limit — the token under test was ~9 minutes old.** Its sibling
`__Secure-next-auth.pkce.code_verifier` / `.state` cookies show a full OAuth bounce
minutes before measurement. The matrix therefore establishes sufficiency **at mint
time**, never for an aged token — which is precisely the CI condition. R1 must include
a day-7 re-run before this is relied on.

### 2.3 The confound that voided three earlier runs

Three runs reused a hard-coded project id. A stale/deleted project renders an error shell
— **~441KB, 3 buttons, 0 icons** — indistinguishable from an auth wall by every metric
measured. Those runs produced the false conclusions *"CI-without-auth is dead"* and
*"DOM auth and API auth are separate gates."* Both retracted.

Replicated independently (arm N2: 431KB / 3 buttons / 0 icons, single variable). **Cause
established, not merely plausible.**

> **Binding consequence:** any probe navigating to a fixed project id can produce a
> convincing false negative. A DOM probe MUST therefore be able to tell "the surface
> did not load" from "a selector drifted", and report the former as inconclusive
> (exit 2) rather than as drift. The CI probe does this with its hydration gate — it
> does **not** create projects, which would be a mutating operation against the $0
> invariant. §2.2 shows the same rule applies in the other direction: an all-HIT
> matrix without a falsifying arm proves nothing either.

### 2.4 Locale is account-driven

> **Superseded 2026-08-27 (#587).** The sentence below — *"Passing `locale="en"` to
> `project_editor_url()` still served `/fx/pt/` in Portuguese"* — is the **inverse** of
> what `scripts/dev/spike_locale_poison.py` measures: Flow serves whatever segment it

> authed/unauthed contrast; the mechanism sentence does not. Do not use it to argue
> that navigating to a cached segment is safe — that design was built and rejected.

Passing `locale="en"` to `project_editor_url()` still served `/fx/pt/` in Portuguese.
The *evidence* for account-attribution is the authed/unauthed contrast at identical
`Accept-Language` and IP: **authed → `pt`, unauthed → `en`, cookie the only variable**
(N0/N2 vs N1/N3).

**Corollary worth its own ticket:** `client.py:416`'s `locale="en-US"` and
`ui_automation.py:77`'s comment that *"`?hl=en` locks locale"* are both **ineffective**.
Selectors MUST be locale-invariant (Material Symbols ligatures, never display text).

### 2.5 Viewport is selector-affecting

`ui_automation.py:117-124` pins `_VIEWPORT = {1920, 1080}` and states that smaller
*"would cross the responsive breakpoint and **drift the selectors**"*. `FlowApiClient`
uses 1280×720 and Playwright's default context is 1280×720 — **both below the
breakpoint**. Any probe not pinning 1920×1080 reports false drift.

### 2.6 Headless is not bot-blocked

Confirmed on the **authenticated full app** (arm N0), from one residential IP. The
earlier unauthenticated observation was of a marketing page and does not support the
claim. Says nothing about datacenter IPs — see R1.

### 2.7 The session token does not rotate on use

`last_update_utc == creation_utc` to the microsecond across a 30-day-old token. A CI
secret is therefore **stable until it hard-dies at day 30** — preferable to a silently
rotating credential, but it fails abruptly rather than degrading.

## 3. Design

### 3.1 Data model

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Surface:
    key: str                     # "editor"
    url_template: str
    viewport: tuple[int, int]    # (1920, 1080) — below the breakpoint drifts selectors (§2.5)

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Selector:
    key: str                     # "editor.composer.input" — stable, public, in reports
    surface: str                 # → Surface.key
    candidates: tuple[str, ...]  # ORDERED: [0] preferred, then cohort variants / fallbacks
    mode: UiMode | None          # None = every mode of that surface
    expect_unique: bool          # True = >1 match is AMBIGUOUS, not HIT (§3.4)
    note: str                    # why fallbacks exist; incident refs
```

**Dropped after council review** (each verified to have zero consumers):

| Field | Why cut |
|---|---|
| `min_plan` / `Plan` enum | No plan-gated selector is in the initial registry. Add the day one is — 4 lines then. |
| `features` | Nothing reads it; `surface` + `note` already carry the context. |
| `required` | All entries defaulted `True`, and its `False` branch returned the same grade as the mode branch. Two encodings, one outcome. |
| `Surface.modes` | Never read — `for_surface()` filters on `Selector.mode`. Same category as `features`, cut in the same review that added it. |

**Keys are a public promise** — they appear in probe reports, and eventually in exit-23 messages.

### 3.2 One pass: navigate, detect, resolve, grade

```
navigate (viewport-pinned) → detect arm → base-state gate → resolve against the
LIVE page → HIT | FALLBACK | AMBIGUOUS | MISS | EXPECTED_ABSENT
```

Resolution runs against the live page, never a re-parsed copy: `set_content()` drops
external CSS/JS and `page.content()` omits shadow roots, so a static round-trip is
strictly lower fidelity than the page already open.

**`observed_mode` is a REQUIRED argument to the grader.** Without it,
`editor.crop_control` (`mode=CLASSIC`) grades MISS = drift on every agentic capture — the
exact error this design exists to prevent. Making it required enforces that at the type
level, which is cheaper and stricter than a sentinel grade for "no context".

**Mode detection must reuse production's detector**, never a reimplementation:
`factory._any_present(page, _CLASSIC_CROP_SELECTORS)` over **all six** ratio variants.
Checking only `candidates[0]` (`crop_16_9`) is a silent-pass hole: a classic editor on a
9:16 project reads as AGENTIC, so `crop_control` grades EXPECTED_ABSENT and real drift
hides permanently. That is the same one-of-six error §2.4 documents.

**Correction to an earlier claim.** This does *not* mean snapshot and live checks "cannot
disagree". `set_content()` drops external CSS/JS and re-executes inline scripts, and
`page.content()` omits shadow roots. Both layers assert **structural presence only**;
neither asserts visible/enabled today.

**Invariant:** reach steps MUST be non-mutating and credit-free.

### 3.3 Where each layer runs

| Layer | Trigger | Credential | Detects |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CI probe** | `schedule` + `workflow_dispatch` | `GFLOW_CI_SESSION_TOKEN` + project id | Google changed the page |
| **Nightly canary** | 03:00 local | maintainer profile | drift on the maintainer's cohort and IP |

**Snapshot fixtures are cut.** With CI probing live, a frozen snapshot only ever detects
*our* regressions, while costing a second capture path, a PII-scrubbing pipeline, and a
committed authenticated DOM in a public repo. The AST guardrail (deferred, §4) covers the
same regression class far more cheaply.

### 3.4 Grading

- **HIT** — `candidates[0]` resolved (uniquely, when `expect_unique`).
- **FALLBACK HELD** — `[0]` missed, a later candidate resolved. Warning, not failure; #493's actual outcome.
- **AMBIGUOUS** — resolved, but matched **>1** element on an `expect_unique` selector.
  Drivers call `.first`, so a second match means gflow clicks the wrong thing while a
  count-based check reports success. `SIDEBAR_CLOSE_FALLBACK_SELECTOR` is deliberately
  unscoped and is the standing candidate for this.
- **MISS** — nothing resolved → drift. The **probe** exits 1 (exit 2 is reserved for
  inconclusive: expired token, dead project, alternate base state). Exit 23 is
  production's `UiSelectorDriftError`, which the probe does not raise — wiring the two
  together is part of the deferred §3.5.
- **EXPECTED_ABSENT** — the observed `mode` says it should not be here.

### 3.5 Rejected: an operator selector override

An earlier draft proposed `GFLOW_CLI_SELECTOR_OVERRIDE`, letting a user patch a drifted
selector from the environment instead of waiting for a release:

```
GFLOW_CLI_SELECTOR_OVERRIDE='editor.count_tabs=[role=tab]:text-is("x1")'
```

**Rejected — recorded here so it is not re-proposed.**

It is a hack: an env var that injects arbitrary DOM selectors into production automation,
papering over the real problem rather than fixing it. The real fix for a rename is a
registry edit and a release; the real fix for *not knowing about the rename* is the probe
this document specifies. An override addresses neither and adds a permanently-supported
public surface whose values nobody can validate.

Three supporting findings, each verified:

- **No demand.** `gh issue list --state all --search "selector override"` → nobody has
  asked, ever.
- **It did not work as specified.** It was wired into the probe, so it would change what
  gflow *checks* and leave what gflow *clicks* untouched — the user stays broken.
- **The borrowed precedent does not transfer.** `notebooklm-py` ships an override for RPC
  method IDs: 6-character strings copied from a network tab, which any user can do.
  Authoring a Playwright selector with `:has()` and Material Symbols ligature matching for
  a React app is a different skill. The only person who could use it is the maintainer,
  who can edit the registry instead.

**What replaces it:** nothing. The probe already reports drift *by key*
(`editor.composer.input DRIFT`), which is the half that carries the value — you learn what
moved the morning it moves.

---

## 4. Migration

1. **Registry + grader** — only selectors present on a **freshly-loaded** editor:
   composer input, composer submit, agent toggle, crop control.

   **#404's count tabs are NOT registerable yet, and that is worth stating plainly.**
   They live inside the generation-settings panel, which must be clicked open
   (`_open_gen_settings_panel`; `_is_settings_panel_open` exists because it is normally
   closed). Registering them would grade MISS on every clean capture. The incident this
   design leans on hardest therefore needs `Reach` — which is the strongest argument for
   prioritising `Reach` in the follow-up, not for registering a selector that reds nightly.
2. **CI probe** — viewport-pinned, detects the arm with production's detector,
   gates on base state, resolves against the live page. `schedule` +
   `workflow_dispatch` only.

**Deferred to a follow-up plan:** `selector_key` on `UiSelectorDriftError`, the AST
guardrail (it flags **9 real offenders** today —
`ui_automation_video.py:91-96,162`, `agentic.py:62`, `diagnostics.py:1738` — so it reds on
arrival while its migration is still deferred), inverting the import direction, additional
surfaces, and §3.5 if the maintainer keeps it.

## 5. Risks

| # | Risk | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | **Datacenter IP** — all measurements from a residential IP. | Unresolvable locally. `workflow_dispatch` once and read the result. Must also include a **day-7 token re-run** (§2.2 scope limit). |
| R2 | **Token hard-dies at day 30** (§2.7 — no rotation, so no warning). | Nightly canary reports remaining life. It MUST pin the profile path — two `profile_denon82` trees exist on the maintainer's machine and the orphaned one reports "expired 38 days ago". |
| R3 | **Project validity** (§2.3). | The hydration gate reports exit 2 (inconclusive) when the surface never renders, so a dead project can never be published as drift. The probe does not create projects — that would be mutating. |
| R4 | **State-gated selectors.** `SIDEBAR_CLOSE` needs an expanded sidebar; **count tabs need the generation-settings panel opened**. A URL-only surface grades both MISS. | Phase 1 registers only selectors present on a freshly-loaded editor. Both wait for `Reach` — including #404's family (§4). |
| R5 | **CI has no browser.** `ci.yml:165` runs plain pytest; no workflow installs Playwright. | Probe workflow installs chromium itself. No default-suite test may require a real browser. |
| R6 | **Secrets in a public repo.** | Dedicated throwaway account, never the maintainer's. Reuse `src/gflow_cli/data/redaction.py` (already covers `Bearer`, `SAPISIDHASH`, `__Secure-next-auth.session-token`, signed queries) for any published output — do not write a fourth redactor. |
| R8 | **Known zero-click alternate states.** `mode_control.py:66-84` — an expanded chat sidebar "removes the classic composer entirely… no `crop_*` trigger AND no Agent pill". `ui_automation_video.py:149-153` — a chat panel "appears on some project opens and not others", and while up "the in-composer pill is NOT in the DOM at all". Both are load states, no clicks. Three of the four registered selectors would MISS there and report drift that did not happen. | The probe checks a **base-state precondition** before grading: if a known alternate-state indicator is present, absence is *explained* → exit 2 (inconclusive), never exit 1. If no indicator is present and the composer is still gone, that is real drift. Reuses production's own detectors. |
| R7 | **Same-repo branch PRs would receive the secret** while checking out attacker-editable probe code. Fork PRs are safe (GitHub withholds secrets). | Never add `pull_request`; never `pull_request_target`. |

---

## 6. Non-goals

- **Not** replacing the driver code in this phase. `selector_key` on
  `UiSelectorDriftError` needs it (all 7 raise sites live in `ui_automation*`, and
  `GFlowError.__init__` takes a fixed kwarg list), so that stays deferred to the
  follow-up, where the drivers start reading from the registry anyway.
- **Not** an operator selector override, ever — see §3.5.
- **Not** a Page Object Model rewrite — POM hides selectors inside classes; enumerability
  is the point.
- **Not** the master token — §2.2 makes it unnecessary. See `[[master-token-tier0-deferred]]`.
- **Not** generation testing. The probe never submits, never spends credits.
- **Not** committed DOM snapshots (§3.3).
- **Not** splitting `ui_automation*.py`. Desirable, separately scoped.
