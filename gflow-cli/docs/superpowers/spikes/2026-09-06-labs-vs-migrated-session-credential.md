# Spike — is the `labs.google` Flow session token a credential for `flow.google.com`?

**Date:** 2026-09-06 · **Issue:** #644 (Refs #639, #642) · **Cost:** $0, read-only, no credits
**Profile:** `denon82` (migrated account) · **Verdict:** NO — and #644 stays LATENT

This spike answers the question a future #644 fix must not re-derive.

## Q1. Is `__Secure-next-auth.session-token` usable on `flow.google.com`?

**No, for two independent reasons.**

### 1a. It is never transmitted (measured)

Cookie jar of `profile_denon82` replayed through `http.cookiejar`'s RFC 6265
`DefaultCookiePolicy` against each host:

| Request host | Cookies sent | `__Secure-next-auth.session-token` | `SAPISID` / `__Secure-1PSID` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `labs.google/fx/tools/flow` | 3 | no (already expired, see Q2) | no |
| `flow.google.com/` | 14 | **no** | **yes** |
| `flow.google.com/project/x` | 14 | **no** | **yes** |

The token is scoped to domain `labs.google`; `flow.google.com` is under `google.com`,
a different registrable domain. Domain-matching never attaches it. **The two hosts
receive disjoint credential sets** — this is the correct half of #644's premise.

### 1b. It is not honoured when forced — **MEASURED**

Re-run against the correct profile with a **live, verified session**
(`denon82@gmail.com`, verified 11:09). Each request sends exactly one credential set
to `https://flow.google.com/`:

| credential sent | bytes | account email in body | GAIA id in body |
|---|---|---|---|
| labs `__Secure-next-auth.session-token` only | 146,488 | ❌ | ❌ |
| Google SSO cookies only | 150,744 | ✅ | ✅ |
| **no cookies at all (control)** | 146,497 | ❌ | ❌ |

**The labs token is indistinguishable from sending nothing** — 9 bytes off the
anonymous control, nonce-level noise, and carrying no identity. The SSO set embeds
the account email and GAIA id directly in the shell.

This upgrades 1b from reasoned to measured: the token confers **zero** authentication
on `flow.google.com`. Consistent with the mechanism — it is an Auth.js/NextAuth handle
minted by and validated against the `labs.google` BFF's own signing secret, while
`flow.google.com` authenticates on Google's standard SSO cookie set.

---

## Q2. Did the divergence #644 predicts appear?

**No — and no evidence either way.** ~~Both hosts agree on signed-out, which is evidence
against independent session lifetimes.~~ **RETRACTED** — that was the stray-directory
read (see the warning at the top). An abandoned profile being logged out says nothing
about the account.

The divergence needs **Google SSO alive + labs Flow session dead**. A fresh login
cannot produce it — login makes *both* alive — so this remains **unobserved**, exactly
as the 2026-09-03 triage concluded. No new evidence for or against.

### What the live run did establish: the instrument works

The pass condition recorded below was, until this run, an **unvalidated guess**. It is
now calibrated against both arms on the same profile:

| profile state | `flow.google.com/` lands on | `avatar` | `signin_cta` | `aria_buttons` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| logged out (stray dir) | `/about` (marketing) | 0 | 1 | 90 |
| **live session** | `/` (app) | **1** | **0** | 47 |

The DOM signal cleanly separates authenticated from anonymous. A future
"no divergence" result from this probe can now be trusted to mean *no divergence*,
rather than *broken instrument*.

### New finding: the frontend has migrated, the auth BFF has not

Navigating to `https://labs.google/fx/tools/flow` **redirected to
`https://flow.google.com/`**, while `labs.google/fx/api/auth/session` still answered
`200 / 653 B / has_user=True` for the same profile at the same moment.

So for this account Google has already moved the **frontend** off `labs.google` while
leaving the **auth BFF** on it. gflow's only auth oracle now lives on the host the user
is actively being redirected away from. That is not the #644 divergence, but it is the
precise coupling that makes **Q4** load-bearing — and it means Q4's trigger is no longer
purely hypothetical: the migration is visibly in progress, with the auth BFF the last
piece still on the old host.

---

## Q3. Does gflow report anything wrong today?

**No.** `gflow auth status` on this profile yields `GOOGLE_SESSION_ONLY`
(stale `SAPISID` present, BFF says no-user) → *"Signed in to Google, but not to the
Flow app"* → re-login. On the measured state that guidance is **correct**.

#644's claimed defect sites are also mis-localized, and a future fix should not start
there:

- `api/client.py:209` `_FLOW_SESSION_COOKIE` is a **log field** (`preread_session=`,
  `client.py:624`) and the #222 macOS seed — not the auth check.
- The auth check is a **live probe** of a live BFF
  (`auth/verification.py::verify_flow_profile` → `fetch_flow_session_httpx`), not a
  cookie-name test. It cannot "inspect the wrong credential"; it asks the server.
- `auth/cookies.py`'s `flow_only=True` filter is a deliberate origin boundary, correct
  for its only consumer (an httpx client that talks solely to `labs.google`). Widening
  it would send `.google.com` SSO cookies to `labs.google` — a regression, not a fix.

**No code change is warranted *for #644 as filed*.** The harvest becomes wrong only when
a browserless path to the migrated host exists; that is #642's scope.

But tracing it surfaced a larger risk that #644 only gestures at — see Q4.

---

## Q4. What actually breaks if `labs.google` is deprecated?

**A re-login loop that the user cannot escape, plus silent profile degradation.**
This is the sharper form of #644's concern, and it is a design question for the owner
rather than something to build speculatively.

`RealChromeStrategy.login` (`auth/real_chrome.py:255`) ends every login with
`verify_flow_profile`, whose **sole oracle** is `labs.google/fx/api/auth/session`.
So that one host's BFF is the gate on every profile's usability — *including profiles
whose actual generation path never touches it* (UI automation, the migrated composer).

Failure sequence once labs stops minting Flow sessions:

1. User runs `gflow auth login` and signs in fully. SSO cookies land;
   `flow.google.com` renders authenticated.
2. `verify_flow_profile` asks labs → no user → `verified = False`.
3. `real_chrome.py:262` **unlinks `.gflow_browser_strategy`** (rollback of the
   speculative write, when the marker did not pre-exist).
4. The user is told to re-run `gflow auth login`. → goto 1, forever.

**Precision, because this is easy to misread** (I did, first time): step 3 fires only
when the marker did **not** pre-exist — i.e. a *first* login on a fresh profile. A
returning profile that was verified once keeps its marker through any probe failure, so
it is not degraded. And the first-login deletion is correct, not a gap: gflow genuinely
could not confirm a session, so it declines to certify the profile. The loop is real,
but its fix is a working oracle (#642), **not** a retained marker.

Step 3 is the load-bearing damage: without that marker `channel_for_profile` stops
returning `"chrome"`, so `FlowApiClient` downgrades to bundled Chromium — which the
code's own comment identifies as the `[[real-browser-auth-mandatory]]` failure. A labs
outage therefore does not merely block login; it **degrades a profile that would still
work through the browser**.

### The discriminator already exists

`ChromeCookieSnapshot.google_session` (`SAPISID` present, computed from the full jar)
already separates the states. What is missing is only that the last row's remediation
is unreachable:

| labs BFF | SSO cookies | outcome today | remediation correct? |
|---|---|---|---|
| user present | — | `AUTHENTICATED` | ✅ |
| `{}` | no `SAPISID` | `NO_SESSION` → re-login | ✅ re-login fixes it |
| `{}` | `SAPISID` | `GOOGLE_SESSION_ONLY` → re-login | ✅ today · ❌ under deprecation, never |
| non-200 | any | `VERIFICATION_ERROR` → "network" | ✅ today · ❌ under deprecation, permanent |

### Not built here, deliberately

The precise failure — a live SSO session that the labs BFF refuses — is still
**unobserved**, and building a host-aware fallback for it would guard something nobody
can demonstrate. That is the trap #644's own triage refused, and it still applies.

**But the trigger is no longer hypothetical.** Q2's live run found the frontend already
migrated for this account (`labs.google/fx/tools/flow` → `flow.google.com`) while the
auth BFF stayed behind. The single oracle gating every profile now sits on the host
Google is actively moving users off. The remaining step to the Q4 failure is that one
endpoint following the frontend it belongs to.

The asymmetry is what deserves the owner's attention: the check is nearly free (the
signal is already in hand), the failure is unrecoverable by the user, and it **cannot be
shipped after the deprecation** — by then every affected user is already stuck on a
version that loops.

### Predict verdict (2026-09-06): STOP on both slices

`/gflow:predict` ran a five-persona council on *"decouple profile validity from the
labs.google BFF"*. Mean confidence 8.2, **−2** because the Devil's Advocate found a
simpler path the other four missed, and one hard STOP. **Verdict: STOP.**

Both originally-proposed slices were withdrawn:

1. ~~*Never let a probe failure delete a marker a successful browser login just
   earned.*~~ **Already shipped, and the rest would be a bug.** The `marker_preexisted`
   guard has protected returning profiles since `a86a335` (2026-07-06, v0.25.0) and is
   pinned by name in
   `tests/auth/strategies/test_strategies.py::test_real_chrome_preserves_preexisting_marker_on_transient_failure`.
   The first-login deletion is *deliberate* — the marker is written speculatively, the
   probe never confirmed a session, and `AuthMissingError` says so. Keeping it would
   leave `.gflow_browser_strategy=chrome` on a profile with no `.gflow_account`, a state
   nothing downstream expects, and would break a passing test. The assertion directly
   above that test pins the deletion.
2. ~~*Give `GOOGLE_SESSION_ONLY` / `VERIFICATION_ERROR` an escape hatch.*~~ **Deferred.**
   It would add control flow to a fail-closed auth path for a state that has never been
   observed, and there is no account in which to write its e2e test — the Iron Law
   cannot be satisfied. If it is ever built, the MCP twin (`gflow_auth_status`, which
   maps `GOOGLE_SESSION_ONLY` → `AuthExpiredError`/401 → "re-run login") must change in
   lockstep, or the loop closes for humans and stays open for agents.

**What shipped instead — the one thing all of this actually justified.** The rollback at
`real_chrome.py` emitted *nothing*. A load-bearing state change that silently downgrades
generation to bundled Chromium, with zero telemetry. It now logs
`auth_chrome_marker_rolled_back` with the `FlowSessionOutcome` value, which separates
"the probe endpoint was unreachable" from "genuinely signed out". Zero behaviour change,
and it is the instrument that would turn #644 from *unobserved* into *observed* on the
day it first happens.

Explicitly **out of scope**, flagged HIGH by the security persona: widening
`cookies.py`'s `flow_only=True` harvest. `SAPISID` is account-wide SAPISIDHASH material,
and Q1b already measured that the target origin ignores a wrong-origin cookie anyway —
all blast radius, no benefit.

### Open follow-up: the probe's retry budget is sized for the wrong failure

`verification.py` retries `_MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3` with a 15 s timeout and 1 s/2 s backoff, and
its `except Exception` retries *any* error rather than only `_RETRYABLE_STATUSES`. So a
hung endpoint costs **~48 s** and an instantly-refused one still burns ~3 s of pure
sleep — on all three call sites (`auth status`, the MCP twin, and the tail of every
login). That budget suits a transient 503, not a deprecated host, and a deprecated host
is more likely to hang at the edge than to 404 cleanly. Not fixed here; worth its own
change if the BFF starts degrading.

## Re-running this probe

Needs a profile under `GFLOW_CLI_HOME` and nothing else. **Resolve the path — never
hardcode it** (see the retraction at the top).

```python
import asyncio, json
import browser_cookie3, httpx
from gflow_cli.auth.cookies import get_chrome_cookie_snapshot
from gflow_cli.paths import default_home, profile_subdir

PROFILE = profile_subdir(default_home(), "<name>")
assert (PROFILE / "Local State").exists(), f"no such profile: {PROFILE}"

async def main():
    snap = await get_chrome_cookie_snapshot(PROFILE)
    print("labs cookies:", len(snap.httpx_cookies),
          "next-auth:", "__Secure-next-auth.session-token" in snap.httpx_cookies,
          "SAPISID:", snap.google_session)

    # A) what verify_flow_profile actually asks
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(cookies=snap.httpx_cookies, timeout=20.0,
                                 headers={"referer": "https://labs.google/fx/tools/flow"}) as c:
        r = await c.get("https://labs.google/fx/api/auth/session")
    has_user = bool(json.loads(r.text).get("user")) if r.text.strip().startswith("{") else None
    print(f"A) labs session -> {r.status_code} {len(r.text)}B has_user={has_user}")

    # B) DOM truth on the migrated host — httpx sees only the SPA shell, so use a browser
    from playwright.async_api import async_playwright
    async with async_playwright() as pw:
        ctx = await pw.chromium.launch_persistent_context(
            user_data_dir=str(PROFILE), channel="chrome", headless=False,
            args=["--password-store=basic"])
        page = ctx.pages[0] if ctx.pages else await ctx.new_page()
        await page.goto("https://flow.google.com/", wait_until="domcontentloaded")
        await page.wait_for_timeout(9000)
        print("B) flow.google.com ->", await page.evaluate("""() => ({
            url: location.href,
            avatar: document.querySelectorAll("img[src*='googleusercontent']").length,
            signin_cta: document.querySelectorAll("a[href*='ServiceLogin']").length,
        })"""))
        await ctx.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

**DIVERGENCE CONFIRMED** iff `A) has_user=False` **and** `B) avatar > 0`.
Anything else is a normal session state.

> Instrument note: `httpx.get("https://flow.google.com/")` returns ~146 KB of Angular
> SPA shell with `WIZ_global_data` for signed-in and signed-out alike. It is **not** an
> auth signal — the 2026-09-03 measurement flagged the same trap. Use the rendered DOM.
