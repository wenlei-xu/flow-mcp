# GitHub PR Protocol

This protocol is the maintainer routing guide for GitHub pull requests. Use it
when deciding what to do with an external or internal PR.

## Quick Triage

1. Confirm the PR targets `develop`. Only release PRs target `main`.
2. Check contributor provenance:
   - commits use a real Git identity or GitHub noreply email
   - external commits include `Signed-off-by:`
   - no secrets, cookies, signed URLs, account tokens, or private captured data
3. Review the diff against the base branch:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin pull/<N>/head:pr-<N>-review
   git diff --stat origin/develop...pr-<N>-review
   git diff --check origin/develop...pr-<N>-review
   ```

4. Run focused tests for the touched behavior before trusting broad CI.
5. Read GitHub checks and comments. Treat bot output as advisory unless it is a
   required project gate or has concrete evidence.

## Automated External PR Triage

External PR routing starts with `.github/workflows/external-pr-triage.yml` (triggered via `pull_request_target`), which performs basic repository metadata operations:

- label external PRs as `external-contribution`
- label them as `needs-maintainer-review`
- label them as `needs-copilot-review`
- request `@ffroliva` as reviewer
- post or update the external-contribution checklist comment

Bot PRs such as Dependabot updates are skipped by this human-contributor triage. They still run normal CI and remain subject to branch protection.

This workflow must not checkout the PR branch, install dependencies, run tests, or execute contributor code. Keep all code execution in the normal `pull_request` CI workflow, where forked PRs do not receive repository secrets.

### PR-Triage Autopilot (VPS Sandbox)

> **Moved out of this repo in v0.71.0.** The runner is hosted privately; `scripts/autopilot/`, `eval/pr_triage_*` and `pr_triage_gate.py` are no longer here. The design notes below are kept as history — do not go looking for the scripts.

An hourly `hermes-ops` cron job triaged eligible external PRs on the host VPS.
- It used the deterministic **Stage 0 pre-filter** (`pr_triage_gate.py`) to confirm eligibility.
- It fetches the PR branch and runs the full `/gflow:pr-council-review` inside an **ephemeral, non-root, read-only Docker container sandbox** (with restricted network egress and no write credentials).
- The host orchestrator posts the review comment to the PR and alerts the maintainer via Telegram.
- For design details, see [2026-07-04-pr-triage-autopilot-design.md](superpowers/specs/2026-07-04-pr-triage-autopilot-design.md) and the implementation plan [PLAN.md](superpowers/plans/2026-07-08-pr-triage-autopilot/PLAN.md).

## GitHub Copilot Code Review

Copilot code review is the first AI review layer for this project. It is
advisory only: Copilot leaves a comment review, does not approve or request
changes, and does not replace maintainer review.

Repository-specific Copilot guidance lives in
`.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Keep those instructions focused on this
project's review risks: auth, browser automation, CI, release, secret handling,
provenance, and focused tests.

Enable automatic Copilot code review in GitHub repository settings/rulesets if
available for the account. If automatic review is unavailable, request Copilot
manually from the PR reviewers menu for PRs carrying the `needs-copilot-review`
label.

## Scenario Matrix

| Scenario | Action |
|---|---|
| Internal PR, all checks green | Review the diff, then squash merge to `develop` when approved. |
| Forked PR, tests/gitleaks green, Sonar skipped | Review manually, then merge to `develop` if the change is low-risk. Sonar runs on trusted pushes after merge. |
| Forked PR, Sonar fails because `SONAR_TOKEN` is empty | Treat as CI configuration behavior, not a code finding. The Sonar job is skipped for forked PRs by design. |
| Forked PR is large, auth/security-sensitive, or unclear | Recreate or cherry-pick the change onto a maintainer-owned branch and open an internal PR so full trusted CI, including Sonar, can run before merge. |
| PR targets `main` | Ask the contributor to retarget to `develop`, or retarget it as maintainer if appropriate. Re-review after retargeting. |
| Contributor metadata is unclear | Ask them to amend author identity and add DCO sign-off. Do not add `Signed-off-by:` for them. |
| Contributor does not respond | Do not merge unclear provenance. Close politely or recreate the fix on a maintainer branch with attribution such as `Reported-by: @user` or `Based on PR #N by @user`. |
| Any required test/lint/type/security check fails | Do not merge until fixed or explicitly documented as an external infrastructure issue. |

## Forked PRs And SonarCloud

GitHub does not pass repository secrets to `pull_request` workflows from forked
repositories, except for `GITHUB_TOKEN`. That means secret-backed jobs such as
SonarCloud cannot run safely on untrusted fork code under the normal
`pull_request` event.

The CI workflow therefore skips SonarCloud for forked PRs and keeps these gates
active:

- Python test matrix
- repo hygiene
- ruff lint and format check
- pyright
- coverage generation
- gitleaks secret scan

This is intentional. Do not switch the normal PR workflow to
`pull_request_target` just to expose `SONAR_TOKEN`; that event runs with base
repository privileges and can expose secrets if it checks out or executes
untrusted PR code.

## SonarCloud Quality Gate

The gate is evaluated on **new code** (changed lines vs `main`, per
`sonar.newCode.referenceBranch`). Conditions: new-code coverage ≥ 80 %,
reliability / security / maintainability rating A, duplicated lines ≤ 3 %, and
all new security hotspots reviewed.

**The gate blocks CI.** `sonar-project.properties` sets
`sonar.qualitygate.wait=true`, so the scanner polls for the verdict and the
`SonarCloud analysis` check goes **red** when the gate is ERROR. Without that
flag the check only confirmed the scan was *submitted* — a failed gate showed a
misleading green while the real verdict sat on the dashboard. If you see a green
`SonarCloud analysis` check, the gate genuinely passed.

### Coverage exclusions (why a refactor can still be green)

Browser-automation and live-auth transports are exercised by the **e2e suite**
(real Chrome / live Flow), not unit tests. They are listed under
`sonar.coverage.exclusions` so unreachable Playwright/network glue does not drag
new-code coverage below the gate:

- `api/transports/ui_automation.py`, `ui_automation_video.py`
- `api/transports/experimental/{bearer,evaluate_fetch,sapisidhash}.py`

Excluded files are **still analysed** for bugs and code smells — only the
coverage metric ignores them. Everything else (CLI, data layer, helpers, REST
plumbing) must hit 80 % on changed lines: add unit tests, don't widen the
exclusion list.

### Reading a red gate

Open the PR Summary at `sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=ffroliva_gflow-cli&pullRequest=<N>`.
- **Coverage failed** → add tests for the changed non-excluded lines.
- **New issues** (e.g. `S5655` "function expects a different type" after a
  `cast(...)` removal) → fix them, or keep the
  `cast(T, ...)  # pyright: ignore[reportUnnecessaryCast]` pattern that satisfies
  S5655/S5890 (removing those casts reintroduces the finding).

### SonarCloud outage handling

SonarCloud is a third-party service and does have outages (seen live
2026-07-16 — a ~504 across its whole API, including the unauthenticated
`/api/system/status` endpoint). The `sonar` job's `Check SonarCloud
availability` step probes that endpoint fresh on every run and skips the
`SonarCloud scan` step (job stays green) when it's down — no manual flag to
remember to flip back once it recovers.

During an outage there's still local coverage: `git push` runs
`scripts/dev/sonar-pre-push-gate.sh` (wired via `.pre-commit-config.yaml`'s
`pre-push` stage — install with `pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push`).
It re-checks SonarCloud itself and only falls back to a scan against the
shared local SonarQube instance
(`../shared-infra/sonarqube`, via `scripts/dev/sonar-local-scan.sh`) when
SonarCloud is unreachable. Both scripts skip gracefully (exit 0) if that
optional local infra isn't checked out — most contributors won't have it,
and that must never block a push. If the outage persists past your push,
re-run the `sonar` job once SonarCloud recovers before merging.

## If Sonar Did Not Run

For small PRs, merge to `develop` after review when tests and gitleaks are
green. Sonar will run on the trusted push to `develop`; if it flags an issue,
fix it before promoting `develop` to `main`.

For larger or risky external PRs, use a maintainer-owned validation branch:

```bash
git fetch origin pull/<N>/head:pr-<N>-review
git switch -c review/pr-<N> origin/develop
git cherry-pick <contributor-commit>
git push origin review/pr-<N>
```

Open an internal PR from `review/pr-<N>` to `develop` and wait for full CI,
including SonarCloud. Preserve attribution in the commit body when appropriate.

## Green PRs Are Not Automatically Cosmetic

A green PR means the configured checks passed in that context. It does not mean
the change is only cosmetic or risk-free.

Use this rule:

- docs-only, formatting-only, and comment-only diffs are cosmetic
- behavior changes require focused review and focused tests
- auth, secret handling, browser automation, CI, release, and network changes
  require extra scrutiny even when CI is green
- Sonar findings are usually maintainability, reliability, security, or coverage
  signals; small findings may be cosmetic, but they still need classification

## Workflow Security Gates

The workflows are themselves a supply-chain surface: they hold a repository
token, `release.yml` publishes to PyPI, and their inputs (branch names, PR
titles, fork content) are attacker-controllable text. Two rules keep that
surface honest, both mechanically enforced. A third gate was evaluated and
declined; § 3 records that decision so it is not re-litigated.

### 1. No checkout persists the job token

Every `actions/checkout` step sets `persist-credentials: false`. The action's
default is `true`, which writes the job token into `.git/config` in the runner
workspace, where it stays for the rest of the job — and travels into any
artifact built from that workspace.

Nothing in this repo needs the persisted credential: no workflow runs `git
push`. `release.yml` publishes through PyPI Trusted Publishing (OIDC) and
`softprops/action-gh-release` (its own token input); `pages.yml` deploys through
`actions/deploy-pages` (OIDC); `governance-advisory.yml`'s `git fetch` is an
unauthenticated read of a public repository, and is redundant with its
`fetch-depth: 0` checkout in the first place.

### 2. `zizmor` audits every workflow on every PR

The `workflow-audit` job in `ci.yml` runs
[zizmor](https://github.com/zizmorcore/zizmor), a static analyser for GitHub
Actions. Run it locally exactly as CI does:

```bash
uvx zizmor==1.29.0 --offline --min-severity low .github/workflows/
```

`--offline` keeps the gate deterministic and fork-safe (the online audits need a
token and network); action pinning and freshness are already covered by
Dependabot and Scorecard's Pinned-Dependencies check.

`ci.yml` is the single source of truth for the pin.
`tests/scripts/test_workflow_hardening.py` reads it from there and asserts that
**the command quoted above matches** — so the gate, the test, and this
documentation cannot drift apart silently. Bumping zizmor means editing exactly
two places: the `run:` line in `ci.yml` and the command above. (Until #568 the
test held its own hand-copied constant and never checked this doc, so this
snippet could — and would — go stale while the sentence promising otherwise
stayed put.)

Two findings are deliberately not fixed, and both are documented where they
live:

| Finding | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `dangerous-triggers` | `external-pr-triage.yml` | `pull_request_target` is required to label a fork's PR. The trigger is only unsafe when the workflow checks out or executes the untrusted head; this one never does — no `actions/checkout` at all, PR fields read from `context.payload`, scoped permissions. Suppressed inline with that rationale. |
| `superfluous-actions` (informational) | `release.yml` | zizmor suggests replacing `softprops/action-gh-release` with `gh release`. Rewriting the release publisher is not a hardening change; declined rather than risked. Informational findings do not gate (`--min-severity low`). |

### 3. Changelog guard — declined (2026-08-22, [#565](https://github.com/ffroliva/gflow-cli/issues/565))

A [changelog-guard workflow](https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill/blob/main/.github/workflows/changelog-guard.yml)
was evaluated for adoption and **declined**. Its central rule — *non-release PRs
must not edit `CHANGELOG.md`* — is the inverse of this project's convention:
gflow-cli follows Keep a Changelog with a live `## [Unreleased]` section that
ordinary feature PRs are expected to update. Adopting it would block almost
every PR the repo merges.

The rest of the reference workflow is either unneeded or already mechanical
here:

- **Changelog fragments** presuppose a towncrier-style fragment directory this
  repo does not have. The `[Unreleased]` section already serves that purpose
  without a second source of truth to reconcile at release time.
- **`release` label exemption** — release-ness is keyed off the branch
  (`chore/release-*`) and base (`main`), already enforced by
  `main-base-guard.yml`. A label would be a third and weaker signal.
- **Version lockstep across manifests** — already enforced by
  `scripts/ci/check_release_artifacts.py` (pyproject ↔ `__version__` ↔
  CHANGELOG section ↔ footer links ↔ `LIVE_VERIFICATION` doc) on every PR into
  `main`, and re-checked against the tag by `release.yml` at publish time.

**Recorded gap, deliberately left open:** nothing stops a non-release PR into
`develop` from bumping a version string — the release-artifact guard only runs
on `main`-targeting PRs. The minimal adaptation would be a `main-base-guard.yml`
job failing a `develop`-targeting PR that changes `version =` in
`pyproject.toml` or `__version__`, exempting `chore/release-*` and `hotfix/*`.
It is not built here because the `main` → `develop` back-merge PR carries
exactly that bump legitimately, so the exemption has to be verified against a
real back-merge before the guard can block anything — and an unverified gate on
the release path is worse than the convention it would replace. Open a
follow-up issue if a stray bump ever actually lands.

## Merge Rule

Merge to `develop` only after:

- base branch is correct
- provenance is clear
- secrets are absent
- focused review is complete
- applicable checks are green, skipped for a documented reason, or reproduced as
  external infrastructure failure

Use squash merge for feature/fix PRs unless there is a specific reason to
preserve commit history.
