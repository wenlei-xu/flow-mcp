## Listener & HTTP-layer debugging

`UiAutomationTransport._attach_batch_response_listener` records every
`batchGenerateImages` response. With `--verbose` you get these structured
log events (`structlog` JSON lines):

| Event key | When it fires | Useful fields |
|---|---|---|
| `ui_automation.image_mode_entered` | After `_enter_editor` + `_dismiss_blocking_overlays`, once the editor has been switched to Image mode. Mirror on the video side: `ui_automation_video.video_mode_entered`. | _(none — presence is the signal)_ |
| `ui_automation.batch_response_seen` | EVERY `batchGenerateImages` URL observed, BEFORE the project-id filter | `url`, `status`, `filter_project_id` |
| `ui_automation.batch_response_dropped_project_id_mismatch` | URL contained `batchGenerateImages` but project-id filter rejected it | `url`, `filter_project_id` |
| `ui_automation.batch_response_captured` | Response passed all filters AND parsed cleanly | `url`, `status` |
| `ui_automation.batch_response_parse_failed` | Listener fired but `response.json()` raised | `url`, `error` |
| `ui_automation.batch_request_intercepted` | EVERY generation request the referenceEntity guard observes, on every exit including a parse error. **Its ABSENCE means no route handler saw the submit at all** — a dead route matcher, or worker delegation the registered level cannot observe (#615, #620) | `url`, `had_reference_entities`, `modified`, `outcome`, `expected_entities` |
| `ui_automation.batch_request_modified` | The guard actually STRIPPED an unrequested `referenceEntities` entry | `url`, `reason`, `expected_entities` |
| `ui_automation.batch_request_modify_failed` | The guard ran but raised (e.g. a body it could not decode); the request is forwarded unchanged | `url`, `error` |
| `ui_automation.batch_403_body` | A `batchGenerateImages` response returned HTTP 403; body prefix logged for WAF / reCAPTCHA diagnosis (subsequently raises `WafRejectionError`) | `body_prefix`, `route` |

If `prompt_submitted` is followed by NO `batch_response_seen` log within the
timeout, the network request didn't fire (or didn't return as a Playwright
`response` event). Most common cause (resolved by [PR #40](https://github.com/ffroliva/gflow-cli/pull/40)
on 2026-05-23): the editor was in Video mode and Flow fired `generateVideo`
instead — the listener filter (`batchGenerateImages` URL) never matched.
Confirm by checking for `ui_automation.image_mode_entered` in the log; if it
is missing, the mode switch did not run.  If `image_mode_entered` is present
but `batch_response_seen` is still missing, the remaining hypothesis is the
historical UI-flake noted in
[`LIVE_VERIFICATION_v0.7.0.md`](LIVE_VERIFICATION_v0.7.0.md#open-follow-ups)
(transient overlay swallowed the arrow-forward click).

**Two extra artifact file names worth searching for in the out dir** when the
mode switch itself fails: `diag_mode_switch_miss.json` (crop-icon dropdown
trigger not found — a structural DOM signature; this probe writes no
screenshot) and `debug_no_image_tab.png` (Image tab missing inside the open
dropdown).

Pipe `--verbose` output through `Select-String` (PowerShell) or `grep` to
filter:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONUTF8 = "1"
uv run gflow --verbose image t2i "prompt" --profile <name> --out tmp\debug 2>&1 |
  Tee-Object tmp\debug\run.log |
  Select-String 'batch_response|aspect_ratio|prompt_submitted|error_unhandled'
```

## Automatic incident bundles

Since v0.43.0, relevant operational failures automatically write a **private
incident bundle** (`GFLOW_CLI_INCIDENT_CAPTURE`, default `true` — see
[CONFIGURATION § GFLOW_CLI_INCIDENT_CAPTURE](CONFIGURATION.md#gflow_cli_incident_capture)).
The human error output prints the bundle path; `--json` carries it as the
`error.incident` object; remote surfaces (MCP/HTTP/worker) receive only an
opaque `{id, capture_status}`.

### Layout

The directory name embeds the **incident id** (`<correlation-id>-<fingerprint>`,
the same value in `manifest.json`'s `incident_id` and the CLI's `incident`
object) between the UTC timestamp and a collision-resistant random suffix:

```text
<GFLOW_CLI_HOME>/incidents/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<UTC-stamp>-<incident-id>-<rand>/
├── manifest.json             # allowlisted facts: version/env, error class + exit
│                             # code + retryable, sanitized route, phase, artifact
│                             # classifications, HAR state, suppression count
├── ui.json                   # structural DOM only: Material-Symbol ligatures,
│                             # signal booleans, tag counts, viewport/scroll,
│                             # bounded overlay geometry — never raw text/HTML
├── network.json              # last ≤100 responses/failures: method, host
│                             # category, canonical route, status, duration
├── browser.json              # last ≤100 console warn/error + ≤50 page errors —
│                             # class/category + length only, never message text
├── report.md                 # pre-filled Markdown bug report: version/platform,
│                             # error class + exit code, artifact pointers — fill
│                             # in "What I was doing" and attach when filing
├── sensitive/screenshot.png  # UI-state failures only — REVIEW BEFORE SHARING
└── .pending                  # present only while a capture is still staging
```

`manifest.json` is written last and marks the bundle complete; a directory
with only `.pending` is a crash leftover and is pruned automatically after
24 h. Retention keeps at most 50 complete bundles / 250 MiB (oldest pruned
at command startup).

### What triggers a capture (and what never does)

Captured: `FlowAppError` (31), `FlowAgentUiError` (25),
`FlowHostMigratedError` (36), `UiModeUnavailableError` (28),
`UiSelectorDriftError` (23), `FlowAccountChooserError` (38),
`TransportTimeoutError` (9), `BrowserSessionClosedError` (15),
`WireFormatError` (7), `WafRejectionError` (10), `NetworkError` (6),
unexpected exceptions while a page is alive, and `ProfileLockedError` (11)
as a **metadata-only** bundle (no Chrome is launched; the local human output
also shows the recorded lock owner's PID/start-time evidence — advisory
only, the kernel lock stays authoritative and nothing is ever reclaimed).

Never captured: expected `ContentPolicyError`, ordinary `AuthExpiredError`,
usage/config validation, cancellation (Ctrl-C). **That `AuthExpiredError` exclusion
now covers one more path than it used to:** since
[#756](https://github.com/ffroliva/gflow-cli/issues/756), landing on one of Flow's
OAuth/sign-in routes raises `AuthExpiredError` where it previously raised
`UiSelectorDriftError`, which *is* captured. The change is deliberate — the remediation
is `gflow auth login` either way, and a bundle there would put a DOM dump and a
full-page screenshot of a Google auth surface into the artifact users are prompted to
attach to issues. It is recorded here because swapping a class silently switches
capture off, which is exactly the trap `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` records. Successful commands write
nothing. At most 3 bundles per command; repeats of the same failure
fingerprint increment `suppressed_count` in the manifest instead.

Capture is **observation-only** (it never retries, navigates, or submits)
and best-effort: the original error, exit code, and traceback always win,
and a capture problem surfaces only as an `incident.capture_failed` log
event.

### Escalation path

The automatic bundle answers "what state was Flow in?". When you need raw
payloads (wire-format surprises, WAF forensics), escalate explicitly to
[`GFLOW_CLI_HAR_PATH`](CONFIGURATION.md#gflow_cli_har_path) — the manifest's
`har_state` field records honestly whether that session's HAR demonstrably
finalized (`disabled` / `pending_flush` / `complete` / `possibly_incomplete`).
Raw HAR is never enabled or copied automatically.

### Assessing a bundle's quality

To score how *useful* a bundle is — not just that it exists —
`scripts/dev/incident_bundle_quality.py` grades any bundle directory against
the five diagnostic questions above plus completeness/fidelity/actionability,
with a hard privacy gate (any leaked identifier → grade F). Reusable on a
bundle a user emails you:

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/dev/incident_bundle_quality.py <bundle-dir> [known-secret ...]
```

It prints a scorecard (grade, per-question YES/NO/N/A, privacy verdict). The
live e2e benchmark (`tests/e2e/test_incident_quality_e2e.py`, credit-free)
enforces quality floors on real bundles so a regression that hollows out the
evidence is caught even though the artifacts still exist.

**It is an opt-in gate, not a CI one** — it needs `-m e2e` and
`GFLOW_CLI_E2E_PROFILE`, so nothing runs it on a pull request. And until #792 it
graded only bundles captured deliberately on a *healthy* page, which is how a bug
that hollowed out every **failure** bundle on the migrated host survived it. The
file now also drives a real failed generation and asserts the DOM capture is not
blank; run it before shipping anything that touches capture or page lifecycle.

### Worker / daemon correlation

In the worker daemon each task rebinds a per-task correlation id (`wk-<task_id>`),
so an incident bundle's id (`<correlation>-<fingerprint>`) is unique per task and
joinable to the queue row and the task's structured-log events — two tasks that
fail the same way no longer collide on one incident id.

## Inspecting Flow's live UI

When a selector breaks, the cheapest path is a DOM snapshot of the page
state at the moment of failure.

### 1. Browser DevTools (manual, free)
Open Flow in real Chrome → DevTools → Elements. Click the gen-settings
panel button (crop icon), then inspect the aspect-ratio tabs. Capture the
`role`, `aria-label`, and exact text content of each tab. Copy that into
the appropriate `_*_CANDIDATES` constant.

### 2. Chrome DevTools MCP (`mcp__chrome-devtools__*`)
Available in this session. Lets an agent drive a Chromium instance
programmatically — click, evaluate JS, take snapshots, list network
requests, run Lighthouse, etc. Useful when you want a snapshot saved
without manual copying. Caveats verified during the v0.7.0 work:
- Launches its own browser; it does NOT share your local `--profile` /
  Chrome user data. Authentication has to happen inside the MCP browser.
- `https://labs.google/fx/tools/flow` returns "quota exceeded, error code
  253" to unauthenticated probes (Flow rate-limits anonymous calls), then
  redirects to Google OAuth. Public marketing pages like `labs.google/fx`
  work fine.
- The accessibility tree (`take_snapshot`) is more reliable than the raw
  DOM for asserting tab labels.
- For authenticated UI inspection, prefer (4) [Playwright trace viewer]
  or ad-hoc DOM-dump instrumentation inside `UiAutomationTransport` —
  both reuse our existing logged-in profile without a parallel sign-in.

### 3. Firecrawl (`firecrawl-scrape` / `firecrawl-interact`)
Best for unauthenticated docs (e.g., Material Symbols icon names, third-
party API references). Not ideal for Flow itself — Flow requires a
logged-in Flow session that Firecrawl's hosted browser doesn't
share with your local profile.

### 4. Playwright trace viewer
For deep diagnosis of a single failed run, switch the transport to record
a Playwright trace, then open `playwright show-trace path/to.zip`. This is
not currently wired into `UiAutomationTransport`; add it ad-hoc when
diagnosing a specific failure and remove after.

## Selector cascades

Long-lived UI selectors should be a CASCADE of likely labels, not a
single match. Pattern:

```python
_ASPECT_TAB_CANDIDATES: dict[str, tuple[str, ...]] = {
    "1:1": ("1:1", "Square", "1×1", "1x1"),
    ...
}
```

For each CLI value, try each candidate with `:text-is(label)` (exact
match — avoids substring collisions like the v0.7.0 `1:1` regression).
First visible-and-clickable wins. Log:
- `matched_label=` when one wins (so you can see WHICH variant Flow is
  currently rendering — useful when triaging future drift).
- `candidates_tried=` on total failure (so the next debug pass knows
  what was attempted).

## Lifecycle & browser state

| Error class | Exit code | What it means | Recover by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BrowserSessionClosedError` | 15 | Playwright page/context/browser was closed mid-call (translated from `TargetClosedError`) | Recreate `FlowApiClient` via `async with` |
| `AuthExpiredError` | 3 | Session cookies no longer valid | `gflow auth login --profile <name>` |
| `AuthBrowserRejectedError` | 14 | Google's sign-in rejected the browser for advertising automation; only the `internal` strategy surfaces it | Re-run `gflow auth login` (default `auto` picks the `chrome` strategy, which retries on a no-automation path) |
| `AuthLoginTimeoutError` | 12 | User did not finish the OAuth flow in time | Run `gflow auth login` again; raise `GFLOW_CLI_AUTH_LOGIN_TIMEOUT` |
| `TransportTimeoutError` | 9 | A single API call exceeded its timeout | Retry; check Flow status |
| `WafRejectionError` | 10 | reCAPTCHA / WAF blocked the request | Wait + retry; verify session is healthy |

For health probes from a worker process, use
`FlowApiClient.health_check()` — it returns `bool` and never raises.

## Reproducing image gen end-to-end

See [`LIVE_VERIFICATION_v0.7.0.md`](LIVE_VERIFICATION_v0.7.0.md) for the
canonical example. Short form:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONUTF8 = "1"
mkdir -p tmp\debug

uv run gflow --verbose image t2i "<prompt>" `
  --profile <your-profile-name> `
  --count 1 `
  --aspect <9:16|16:9|1:1|4:3|3:4> `
  --out tmp\debug
```

## Test suite memory

The full smoke set (`-m "not e2e and not live"`) with `--cov=gflow_cli`
runs cleanly in a plain shell (~90 s on a developer laptop, ~700 tests).
Inside the **context-mode MCP sandbox**, coverage instrumentation crosses
the sandbox's memory ceiling and the MCP sidecar exits with
`Connection closed`. Workarounds when running inside MCP:
- Run dirs separately: `tests/api` → `tests/auth tests/cli` →
  `tests/features` → `tests --ignore=...` (everything else).
- Or drop `--cov` while iterating; re-enable for the final pass in a
  plain shell.

## Windows console encoding

PowerShell defaults to cp1252. Rich/structlog output that includes the
`●` glyph (used in `gflow auth` profile tables) will crash with
`UnicodeEncodeError`. Always export UTF-8 before `gflow` calls:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONUTF8 = "1"
```

Bash users on Git Bash / WSL inherit a UTF-8 locale and don't need this.

## WAF cadence

Flow's WAF reacts to **cumulative submission cadence**, not individual
requests. Field data (issue [#241](https://github.com/ffroliva/gflow-cli/issues/241),
2026-07-05, real account):

- 3-prompt multi-prompt runs spread 30–60 min apart all passed.
- A burst of ~14 image submissions in ~10 min ended in a **403**
  (`Flow returned 403; blocked by WAF or fingerprint check`,
  `PUBLIC_ERROR_UNUSUAL_ACTIVITY` — see
  [KNOWN_ISSUES § batchGenerateImages HTTP 403](../KNOWN_ISSUES.md)).
- After ~30 min of cooldown, individually-paced calls (45–120 s apart) on the
  same profile and project passed 4/4.

Practical guidance:

- **Pace multi-prompt runs — escalate only when needed.** All multi-prompt
  image paths (`image batch`, `image t2i --prompts-file` / `--stdin` /
  multiple prompts, `gflow run` image batches) apply a small random
  0.5–1.5 s pause between submissions by default — enough to break a
  perfectly uniform burst signature without wasting wall-clock. If runs
  start returning 403s, widen with `--jitter 10-30` or
  `GFLOW_CLI_JITTER_RANGE` ([CONFIGURATION § GFLOW_CLI_JITTER_RANGE](CONFIGURATION.md#gflow_cli_jitter_range)),
  then dial back once the score decays. `--jitter 0` disables pacing.
- **Cool down after a 403.** Wait 30–60 min, then probe with a single small
  generation before batching again.
- **Reuse a project.** Repeated project churn (`project.createProject` calls
  between generations) adds to the bot-like signature. For repeated
  single-prompt runs (`t2i`, `i2i`), pass `--project` to reuse a standing
  project. Multi-prompt runs already create only **one** shared project per
  run (never one per prompt).

## Common failure modes

See [`KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](../KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for the canonical list and
remediations. The most-hit categories:
- **Flow UI drift** → selector cascade needs a new candidate
  ([selector-cascades](#selector-cascades))
- **Session expiry on a long-running worker** → use `health_check()`
  + recreate on `BrowserSessionClosedError`
- **reCAPTCHA score too low** (generation, *not* sign-in) → must use real Chrome
  (`--browser chrome`). Sign-in is a separate question: the 2026-09-08 spike measured
  `navigator.webdriver`, not the binary, as what Google's sign-in rejects.
