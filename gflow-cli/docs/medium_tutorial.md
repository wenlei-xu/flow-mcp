# Control Google Veo and Imagen from Your Terminal with gflow-cli

Google Flow provides access to Google's video model, Veo, and its image model, Imagen. Google exposes these models through a web interface. gflow-cli brings them to your terminal.

gflow-cli is an unofficial Python command-line interface. It uses a reverse-engineered private REST API to drive image and video generations. You can script, batch, and pipe your creative workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
* Python 3.11 or newer.
* The `uv` package manager.
* A Google account with access to Google Flow.
* A desktop environment to complete the one-time authentication.

## Step 1: Install gflow-cli and Chromium

Install the CLI tool using `uv`:

```bash
uv tool install gflow-cli
```

Download the Chromium browser binary for Playwright:

```bash
uv tool run --from gflow-cli playwright install chromium
```

This download requires 150 MB of disk space.

## Step 2: One-Time Authentication

Authenticate your Google account. Run the following command:

```bash
gflow auth login
```

This command opens a Chrome window. Google rejects any browser that *advertises* automation (`navigator.webdriver`) — not Playwright as such — and both the default `auto` and an explicit `--browser chrome` launch with the flags that keep it `false`. Log in to your Google account. Solve any CAPTCHA challenges.

Keep going until the Flow editor itself loads. gflow detects the completed sign-in and closes Chrome for you; closing the window yourself also works. The CLI saves your cookies in a user-local directory (for example, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\gflow-cli\` on Windows or `~/Library/Application Support/gflow-cli/` on macOS).

Verify your session status:

```bash
gflow auth status
```

The output confirms your cookie status.

## Step 3: Generate a Text-to-Image Still

Generate images using the `image t2i` command. Define your prompt and select an aspect ratio:

```bash
gflow image t2i "a serene mountain lake at dawn" --model nano-pro --aspect 16:9
```

Supported aspect ratios are `9:16`, `16:9`, `1:1`, `4:3`, and `3:4`. 

Model choices:
* `nano2`: Fast generation with balanced quality. This is the default.
* `nano-pro`: Higher quality.
* `image4`: Photorealistic outputs.

The command saves the files to a date-partitioned folder inside your output directory. You can specify a custom output directory:

```bash
gflow image t2i "neon cyberpunk alley" --aspect 16:9 --out ./my-images
```

## Step 4: Generate a Text-to-Video Clip

Generate a video using Google Veo with the `video t2v` command:

```bash
gflow video t2v "a steam locomotive moving through the snow at dusk" --aspect 16:9 --seed 4242
```

The `--seed` flag provides reproducibility. The command returns a standard `.mp4` file in your output directory.
