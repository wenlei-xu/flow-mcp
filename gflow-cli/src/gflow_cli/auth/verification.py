"""Flow app-session verification — the single source of truth for
"is this profile signed in to the Flow app?".

A profile can hold Google SSO cookies (e.g. SAPISID) without holding the Flow
app's NextAuth session (`__Secure-next-auth.session-token`). Only the latter
authenticates Flow's tRPC API. This module probes the same surface
`FlowApiClient` authenticates on — the NextAuth session endpoint — so a login
is never reported successful unless a real, usable Flow session exists.
