"""D.2.4 UiAutomationTransport — Playwright persistent-context driver for Flow.

Empirically validated 2026-05-12: mirrors the proven CG Worker pattern
(``scripts/smoke_worker_style.py``). Playwright manages its own internal CDP
port, the strategy reuses a pre-authenticated profile dir, and prompts are
submitted by typing into Flow's editor — the same surface a human developer
uses on a Pro/Ultra plan. ``batchGenerateImages`` responses are captured via
``page.on("response")`` and parsed for image URLs.

Implementation arrives in per-method TDD units; this skeleton pins the
Protocol contract.

# variant of the icon anchor covers host elements that are not ``<button>``

        reshaped text reaches the composer at **~5.4 s**, while this method used to
        wait ``_jitter_ms(500)`` and return. ``_send_prompt`` submits on the very
        next line, so ``--format-prompt`` shipped the prompt the user typed and
        discarded the rewrite — on every run, with ``prompt_formatted`` logged and
        exit 0. The defect was never the duration. It was reporting a success we
        had not observed: the absence of a completion inside a window we chose,
        recorded as a completion. See
        ``docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-09-07-format-click-is-not-a-format.md``.

        The gate is the DOM, not the wire. ``eAenfb``'s response arrives **4.2 s
        before** the text settles, so awaiting it would reproduce the same early
        submit — and an undocumented ``batchexecute`` rpcid is not an anchor this
        project is willing to depend on. Comparing the box against the string we
        inserted is locale-invariant by construction: it never reads a display label.

        A **length delta** rather than ``!=`` because Slate/ProseMirror re-render
        and normalise whitespace; bare inequality would fire on that churn and
        re-report the same false success with better telemetry.

        The enabled check is NOT redundant with the visible check. Flow ships this
        button ``disabled`` while the prompt box is empty (verified 2026-07-27), and
        a disabled button is still *visible* — so visibility alone would hand a
        disabled element to ``click()``, which auto-waits for actionability and
        stalls for the full timeout. A disabled match means THAT anchor resolved to
        the wrong element, so the cascade continues rather than aborting: the old
        ``return False`` here let one stale anchor kill every selector behind it.

           (stay-mounted batch: panel may already be open from the prior prompt).
        2. Read the currently-displayed count via :data:`_COUNT_TAB_TEXT_RE` —
           immune to Mode/Aspect tabs, matches both label cohorts.
        3. If it already matches ``count``, return early (no click needed).
        4. Click the tab selected by :func:`_count_tab_locator_for` — keyed on
           the digit in the label (``1x``/``x1`` for count=1), NOT position:
           Flow's label rename shrank the old filtered set and shifted every
           positional pick by one (issue #404).

        N URLs). We poll until we have enough fresh responses (those whose
        ``ts >= submit_time``) or the timeout expires.

        **Defense A — post-submit-time filter (primary correctness fix):**
        Each captured entry carries a ``ts`` field written by the handler at
        append time (``time.monotonic()``). Only entries with
        ``entry["ts"] >= submit_time`` count toward ``expected_count``.  This
        eliminates the cross-contamination bug where a listener attached
        *before* the submit click inherits stale responses from prior prompts
        that arrived in the window between attach and click.

        When ``submit_time`` is 0.0 (the default, used by
        ``_capture_batch_response`` and legacy callers), all entries pass the
        filter, preserving backwards compatibility.

        **Straggler window:** after the count threshold is first reached the
        method waits an additional ``straggler_window_s`` seconds so that any
        slower same-submission responses (e.g. the last of a 2-image batch)
        can arrive before the list is snapshotted. This mirrors the Worker
        pattern (``_wait_for_n_new_images`` in the compile-growth monorepo).

        Raises ``TimeoutError`` if no fresh responses arrive within

        Current Flow (live 2026-07-26) exposes a Create Body button carrying
        the locale-independent ``accessibility_new`` icon. Clicking it reuses
        the existing Slate box. The generated-face reference chip must become
        visible before this method returns ``True``; that structural signal
        proves the shared box now belongs to body mode.

        Legacy DOM evidence (2026-06-02 spike) showed the character editor renders
        two ``add_2`` ligatures that are STRUCTURALLY distinct (see the
        ``_CHARACTER_SLOT_ADD_SELECTOR`` constant for the full DOM): the slot-add
        target is a ``[role=button]`` whose accessible content is icon-ONLY,
        while the decoy is a ``<button>`` that also carries a hidden text-label
        ``<span>``.  The previous ``.nth(1)`` heuristic was wrong — it indexed
        into a ``<button>``-only locator that never even matched the slot-add
        div.

        Selection logic (language-agnostic):

        1. Locate every ``[role=button]`` that hosts an ``add_2`` icon.
        2. Keep only the icon-ONLY candidates — those whose stripped
           ``inner_text`` is exactly the ``add_2`` ligature.  The decoy's hidden
           label lengthens its inner_text, excluding it.
        3. If exactly one icon-only candidate remains, click it.  If several
           remain, prefer the first (the slot-add renders adjacent to the
           character image slots, ahead of any other icon-only ``add_2``).

        The localised ``aria-label`` is intentionally NOT part of the predicate
        ([[flow-locale-leak-icon-ligatures]]); the icon-only test is the anchor.

        The legacy path returns ``False`` because it mounts a second prompt
        box. Non-fatal here: a miss is logged at WARNING.  Enforcement lives in
        ``_locate_body_prompt_box`` — if the body composer's own prompt box
        never mounts, the body step ABORTS instead of typing into whichever
        slot is currently active (which would overwrite the portrait prompt).
