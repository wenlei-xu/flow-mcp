"""S1 EvaluateFetchTransport — Playwright page.evaluate(fetch).

Mirrors the existing Compiled Growth Worker's proven approach. Flow's own
JavaScript layer attaches the Authorization: Bearer header before fetch()
leaves the browser. page.request.post() bypasses that JS layer — this
strategy avoids that pitfall by firing fetch from inside the page context.

Lifecycle:
    setup(profile_dir)           — launch own persistent context, open page, navigate to Flow.
    setup(profile_dir, page=p)   — shared-page path: reuse caller's Page, skip own launch.
    generate_images(*)           — page.evaluate("async (args) => fetch(...)").
    refresh_auth()               — re-navigate to Flow URL to refresh page-context tokens.
    teardown()                   — close page + context + stop playwright (idempotent).
                                   No-op when _owns_playwright is False (caller owns context).
