"""Alternative transport strategies retained for future research.

These strategies were explored during the B-007 initiative (2026-05).
Each implements ``FlowTransportStrategy`` and remains importable for
diagnostic and research purposes. None is the default transport.

Enable at the CLI surface by setting ``GFLOW_CLI_EXPERIMENTAL_TRANSPORTS=1``
in the invoking environment before running ``gflow``.
