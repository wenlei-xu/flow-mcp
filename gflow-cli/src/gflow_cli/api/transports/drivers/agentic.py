"""AgenticFlowUiDriver — the agentic (conversational) Flow composer layout.

Grounded by live capture 2026-06-14 (docs/AGENT_UI_RECON.md §§ "DOM scraping
validation", "Settings via prompt, not the tune popover"):

- Assets render as ``<img src="https://labs.google/fx/api/trpc/
  media.getMediaUrlRedirect?name=<uuid>[&mediaUrlType=…]">`` nodes.
- ONE asset produces MULTIPLE ``<img>`` nodes (full-res + thumbnail variants);
  scraping must deduplicate by ``name=<uuid>``, not by raw node count.
- Page-level network capture captures 0 entries (Web-Worker delegation); DOM
  scraping is the only viable capture path in the agentic cohort.
- The ``flag`` ligature is a normal per-message chat affordance (matched 11×
  on a successful generation) — it MUST NOT be treated as a policy signal.
- Settings are encoded in the prompt directive AS THE PRIMARY mechanism; the
  ``tune`` Radix-popover is driven as a best-effort FALLBACK for image count
  only (issue #313 — a stale sticky default there can silently override the
  natural-language directive). See ``_enforce_image_count_via_settings_panel``.

**Circular-import discipline:** this module must never import ``ui_automation``
or ``ui_automation_video`` at module load time. All such imports happen inside
the method body (function-level late import).

# Flow's UI (docs/AGENT_UI_RECON.md § "Settings via prompt, not the tune
# popover"). A sticky prior value in this panel can silently override the
# natural-language directive's requested count — that mismatch is issue
# #313's root cause.
#
# Reuses classic mode's count-tab primitives (_count_tabs_locator,
# _COUNT_TAB_TEXT_RE, UiAutomationTransport._is_settings_panel_open) via late
# import — live-verified 2026-07-16 that Flow's Agent settings panel uses the
# SAME role="tab"/aria-selected Radix pattern as classic mode's count
# popover: 8 matching [role="tab"] elements appear when the panel is open (4
# for "Image generation default", 4 for "Video generation default"), with
# the image section's 4 tabs always rendering first in DOM order. The tune
# open-trigger, the explicit Save requirement (classic's popover applies
# live, this panel does not), and the never-raise contract (classic's
# _set_count raises on failure since it has no fallback; this method DOES
# have a fallback — the natural-language directive — so it must degrade
# instead) are the genuine differences that prevent calling _set_count
# directly.

# The page has TWO ``arrow_back`` icon buttons when the panel is open: the
# main toolbar's "Voltar"/back-to-gallery button (live-verified 2026-07-16 —
# present at all times, NOT removed while the panel is open) and the panel's
# OWN header back arrow. Both happen to satisfy "walk up N ancestors and find
# a count-tablist" (Flow's DOM nests broadly enough that even the toolbar
# button reaches a shared ancestor within a few levels) — so picking the
# FIRST candidate that satisfies the walk (as an earlier version of this code
# did) can silently grab the WRONG one and navigate away from the project
# entirely. The fix: check EVERY arrow_back candidate and take the one with
# the SHALLOWEST (closest) matching ancestor — the panel's own back arrow is
# always structurally adjacent to its tablist (depth 1, live-verified);
# the toolbar's only reaches a shared ancestor much further up (depth 4+).

        assets. Counting by raw node count over-counts ~3×; this method
        counts **distinct ``name=<uuid>`` values** extracted from the src
        attribute of every ``<img>`` on the page.

        **Timeout:** 180 s (matching the classic transport's ``_await_captured``
        default). On partial completion the error detail includes the
        produced-vs-requested mismatch count.

        **Baseline settle (issue #281):** a single baseline scrape can miss
        pre-existing project tiles that lazily render a moment later — those
        would then be miscounted as "new" media and silently attributed to
        this generation (the 2026-07-10 production incident: a pre-existing
        logo was downloaded and reported as a fresh portrait). The baseline is
        therefore the UNION of two scrapes separated by one
        ``_POLL_INTERVAL_S`` sleep, so a lazy tile rendering between the two
        passes still counts as pre-existing, not new. This adds one poll
        interval of wall time up front; the total poll timeout budget
        (``_AWAIT_TIMEOUT_S``) is unchanged.

        **Stable break (issue #283):** reaching ``expected_count`` on a single
        scrape is not trusted — a lazily-rendered pre-existing tile can
        transiently hit the exact count. The loop breaks only when the same
        new-UUID set holds across two consecutive scrapes (~one extra 0.5s
        poll). Deliberate fall-through: a set that first reaches the exact
        count on the final poll before the deadline is returned unconfirmed —
        better a last-second success than a spurious timeout.

        **Ambiguity fail-fast (issue #281):** if more new UUIDs appear than
        were requested, there is no reliable way to tell which ones belong to
        this generation. Rather than arbitrarily slice the unordered set (the
        prior, buggy behaviour), this raises ``MediaAttributionError`` naming
        every candidate UUID and the expected count. The caller should re-run
        the generation — ideally in a dedicated project with fewer
        pre-existing assets, which avoids the ambiguity entirely.

        **Content-policy fail-fast (conservative):** scans for explicit text
        (``"content policy"`` / ``"can't create"`` / ``"violat"`` / ``"not able
        to generate"``) and the ``warning``/``error``/``block`` Material Symbol
        ligatures. The ``flag`` ligature is excluded (normal chat affordance).

        *miss* (timeout) over a false *positive* (spurious ContentPolicyError).
