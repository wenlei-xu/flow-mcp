"""Runtime DOM probe → bind the matching FlowUiDriver strategy.

Detection is the only reliable cohort signal: the client-visible state
(localStorage, JS cookies) is byte-identical across cohorts, so there is no
pre-navigation flag to read (docs/AGENT_UI_RECON.md § "Gating mechanism"). The
rule, validated by live capture:

  * **classic** — the locale-stable ``crop_*`` media trigger is present.
  * **agentic** — ``crop_*`` is absent AND an agentic indicator ligature
    (``tune`` / ``apps_spark_2`` / ``article_spark`` / ``edit_square``) is present.
  * **default** — classic (the safe, established path) when neither matches
    (e.g. mid-load or an unrecognised shape).

The cohort flaps per page load, so callers must re-probe **per generation** —
never cache a driver across navigations.

This module is the detection source of truth for the AGENTIC indicators:
``AGENTIC_INDICATOR_SELECTORS`` and ``AGENT_TUNE_INDICATOR_SELECTOR`` are
canonical here, and the UI transports (``ui_automation``,
``ui_automation_video``) import them rather than redefining them. The CLASSIC
crop tuple is the one exception: its canonical home is ``mode_control`` (the
leaf module — it may import nothing from ``drivers``, so the dependency points
factory→mode_control for that tuple only).
``tests/api/transports/test_selector_symmetry.py`` locks both directions.
