"""Video-generation methods for UiAutomationTransport.

Mixed into `UiAutomationTransport` via `VideoGenerationMixin` — kept in its own
module because `ui_automation.py` is already over the 800-line cap.

Video generation mirrors `generate_images`: the transport drives the Flow
editor UI and Flow's own JavaScript builds the request, sends it, and mints
reCAPTCHA on submit — the transport never POSTs a generate body. The status
endpoint returns HTTP 401 to `page.request.post`, so polling captures Flow's
own `batchCheckAsyncVideoGenerationStatus` responses instead of issuing the
POST (spec §5.5).

# Composer "Agent" mode toggle. Flow's newer editor puts a pill toggle next to
# the prompt box: a ``<button>`` whose only label is a ``<span class="content">``.
# When Agent mode is on, the whole media-generation panel is REMOVED from the
# DOM — the aspect/settings button (the locale-stable ``crop_*`` icon trigger
# keyed on by MODE_SWITCH_TRIGGER_SELECTORS / GEN_SETTINGS_BUTTON_SELECTORS), the
# Image/Video tablist, and the count/model controls all disappear, so
# ``_switch_to_image_mode`` / ``_switch_to_video_mode`` raise "mode-switch
# dropdown trigger not found". Clicking the pill returns to media mode.
#
# This selector is deliberately STRUCTURAL — no localized text and no ARIA:
#  * No localized text: the pill's "Agent" label is translated in some Flow
#    locales, so matching it by visible text would regress non-English users
#    (issue #24: locale-agnostic selectors — a recurring source of PR pushback in
#    this module). The only ``:text(...)`` here is ``arrow_forward``, a Material
#    Symbols icon ligature, which is locale-invariant — the same technique the
#    module already uses for ``crop_*`` / SUBMIT_BUTTON_SELECTORS anchors.
#  * No ARIA: aria-* anchors have also been pushed back on in past reviews, and
#    one is not needed here — Agent mode is detected from the *absence* of the
#    ``crop_*`` media trigger, so the toggle only has to be located, not have its
#    state read.
#
# SCOPED to the generation composer (PR #124 review must-fix): the pill is
# matched only inside the element that holds BOTH the Slate prompt box AND the
# ``arrow_forward`` submit button. Page-wide there is exactly one
# ``button:has(span.content)`` today (live-verified count == 1), but ``.first``
# on the bare global selector would silently grab the wrong element if a future
# Flow build added another ``span.content`` button (header/sidebar) ordered
# before the pill. Scoping to the prompt+submit composer keeps the match correct
# regardless of unrelated additions elsewhere. The composer's own ancestor chain
# carries no stable id/role/data-* attribute (all styled-component hashes), so
# the prompt box and submit icon ARE the stable structural anchors. Uniqueness is
# pinned by a structural unit test (decoy outside the composer) and asserted live

# then fires the plain `batchAsyncGenerateVideoText` route (image ignored). The
# frame slot MUST be filled through its own dialog: click the slot
# (div[aria-haspopup='dialog'] labelled Start/End) -> 'Upload media' (opens a
# file chooser) -> wait uploadImage -> 'Add to Prompt' to commit it into the
# slot. Only then does the DOM Generate click fire StartImage/StartAndEndImage.
UPLOAD_IMAGE_ROUTE = "uploadImage"
# Frame slots are `<div type="button" aria-haspopup="dialog">` — Flow uses a
# div-with-button-semantics custom component for the Start/End slots in I2V mode.

# DE 'Anfang'/'Ende', JA '開始'/'終了', etc.).
#
# Tier 1 (PRIMARY, locale-free): `FRAME_SLOTS_STRUCT` matches the exact pair via
# the `type='button'` + `aria-haspopup='dialog'` composite — a unique pattern in
# Flow's editor (regular elements don't carry a `type` attr on divs). Order is
# DOM order: `.nth(0)` = Start, `.nth(1)` = End.
#
# Tier 2 (FALLBACK, EN-only): `FRAME_SLOT_BY_LABEL` matches by visible English
# text. Kept for defense-in-depth in case Flow drops the `type` attribute on
# the slots; the fail-loud `RuntimeError` in `_attach_frame` covers the case
# where both tiers miss on a non-EN profile.
#
# Caller labels are always the hardcoded constants 'Start' / 'End', so no

#
# Earlier PR #70 used a structural anchor
#   `div:has(> button:has(i.google-symbols:text-is('swap_horiz')))`
# as the parent of the dialog slots. That anchor was broken on real Flow DOMs because
# (1) the slots are `<div type="button">` not children of any `div > button`
# wrapper, and (2) the `swap_horiz` icon uses class `material-icons` (NOT
# `google-symbols`). PR #70's structural tier therefore matched ZERO elements
# on every profile, silently falling through to the text-tier which only
# matched on EN. This was discovered 2026-05-26 via DOM probe on pt-BR — see

# The picker grid is virtualised (react-virtuoso): off-screen tiles are not in

# reachable depth at ATTEMPTS * DELTA px, so an asset deep in a crowded
# project (100+ media) was unreachable and the picker gave up on an asset
# that WAS in the project. The scroll loop is therefore bounded by evidence
# of progress — keep scrolling while the set of rendered tile identifiers
# still CHANGES between scrolls, stop after STALL_LIMIT consecutive scrolls
# with no new tiles (end of grid) — with MAX_ATTEMPTS as a hard safety

        the credit-bearing arm — veo-quality costs 100 against veo-lite's 10.

        Refusing is unambiguously correct here, unlike the image panel-miss,
        which stayed a warning. ``configure_video_settings`` calls this **only**
        when ``effective_model is not None``, and ``--model`` defaults to
        ``None`` on every video command, so reaching this function means a model
        was EXPLICITLY requested. There is no "default or asked-for?" ambiguity.

        AMBIGUOUS is a failure, not a ``.first`` guess: ``.first`` resolves by
        DOM order, so an ambiguous selector silently picks whichever Flow renders
        first and changes behaviour with no code change on our side.
        ``has-text`` is a SUBSTRING match and ``Veo 3.1 - Lite`` is a prefix of
        ``Veo 3.1 - Lite [Lower Priority]``, so this is a live hazard, not a
        theoretical one.

        Reliability (issue #125): the trigger click occasionally does not open
        the menu. We click the trigger and probe up to two times, pressing
        Escape between attempts to reset the dropdown state.

        Runs before frame attach and submit, so a refusal spends nothing.

        Issue #170: a single localized has-text selector broke every
        non-Portuguese account. Tiers are probed sequentially (not flattened
        into one comma list — comma lists resolve in DOM order, not tier
        priority) and the matched tier is logged so a dead locale-free tier
        silently carried by the text fallback stays observable.

        On exhaustion: capture a screenshot, press Escape twice (context menu
        + picker dialog — a Page must never return to the pool with an open
        overlay), and raise a typed, locale-neutral
        :class:`TransportTimeoutError` so the CLI surfaces the remediation
        hint with exit 9 instead of the privacy-hashed 'Unexpected error.'.

        Known cause (2026-08-03): an **unpinned playwright** — an install that
        resolved 1.62.0 against a project locked to 1.59.0 wedged every
        ``video i2v`` run immediately after the frame upload. ``uv tool

          and bills a text-only clip. Observed live 2026-05-30 on omni-flash,

          right but was never interpolated toward the end frame. Not previously
          detectable: until #626 no model could legally carry an end frame that
          Flow might drop, so the T2V check above was sufficient.
