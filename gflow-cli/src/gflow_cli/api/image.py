"""Pure value objects and body builders for image generation.

No I/O lives in this module — `FlowApiClient.generate_images()` (added in a
later task) calls `_build_batch_generate_images_body()` and POSTs the result.

Wire format discovered from the captured samples:
- `samples/captured/06_batchGenerateImages.json` (T2I baseline, 9:16, NARWHAL)
- `samples/captured/07_batchGenerateImages_seeded.json` (I2I, 4:3, NARWHAL)

Key wire-format observations:
- `clientContext` is duplicated at the top level AND inside `requests[0]`,
  with the SAME recaptcha token in both places.
- `useNewMedia: true` is set at the top level.
- `imageInputs` is always present in `requests[0]` — empty list for T2I,
  populated for I2I. Never missing, never null.
- Multi-image quantity is encoded by the caller as N parallel POSTs sharing
  one `batchId` but each with its own seed and reCAPTCHA token. This module
  only builds ONE request body at a time.
