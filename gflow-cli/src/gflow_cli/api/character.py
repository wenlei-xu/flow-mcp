"""Domain models and parser for Flow Character entities.

Characters are project-scoped entities (entityType=CHARACTER) returned inside
``projectInitialData.projectContents.entities``.  This module is pure data —
no I/O.  The parser extracts only stable ids from the wire; signed URLs
(fifeUrl, thumbnailUrl, etc.) are intentionally dropped so that nothing
persisted contains a credential-bearing URL (scenario #16).
