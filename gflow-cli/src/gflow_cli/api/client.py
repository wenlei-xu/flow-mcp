"""FlowApiClient — typed wrapper around Flow's private REST surface.

Architecture: the client manages its own Playwright persistent-context
lifecycle (async context manager). All HTTP goes through page.request so
Google's session cookies attach automatically.

Usage:
    async with FlowApiClient(profile_dir) as client:
        project = await client.create_project()
        asset = await client.upload_image(project.project_id, Path("hero.png"))

        NEVER posts directly to a generation REST endpoint.  The transport's
        ``generate_character_images`` is the only call that may trigger network
        I/O.

        The generated image is downloaded INSIDE this client boundary using the
        signed ``fifeUrl`` carried by the captured response.  That signed URL is
        used ONLY for the download and is NEVER returned to the caller or logged

        downloadable image, ``local_path`` is ``None`` (a warning is logged) and
        the method still returns the ids so the saga can proceed.

        Args:
            project_id: Flow project that owns the character entity.

            image_reference_index: 0-based slot index for the character image
                reference (0 = face/first slot).
            locale: BCP-47 locale forwarded to the UI transport so Flow renders
                in the correct language.  Defaults to ``"en-US"``.
            format_prompt: Whether to click Flow's prompt-format button before
                submitting (rewrites the prompt into Flow's character shape).
