"""Saga: create a Flow Character (persist-before-spend, crash-recoverable).

The saga owns the 4-step character creation transaction:

  1. Entity creation  (free REST)
  2. Persist STARTED  (persist-before-spend gate)
  3. Face generation  (credit)
  4. Body generation  (credit, optional)
  5. PATCH entity     (free REST)
  6. Persist SUCCEEDED

If a crash occurs anywhere after step 2, the STARTED row in the database
contains the entity_id and any workflow/media ids already recorded.  On the
next invocation, :func:`character_create` detects the incomplete row, reuses
the entity_id, and skips any generation steps whose ids are already recorded.

A failure with NO slot committed is the one case that cannot be resumed: the
row's key is (project_id, name), so a retry under a different name never finds
it.  That case rolls the free entity back and flips the row to FAILED, instead
of leaving an ``Untitled Character  refs=0`` behind on every failed attempt.

Scenario coverage (mirrors the plan's test-scenario numbering):
  #3  recovery – resume finds entity_id, skips create_entity
  #4  recovery – resume skips already-recorded face slot
  #5  WireFormatError (parentEntityId mismatch) → record FAILED, re-raise
  #22 face then body are SEQUENTIAL (never gathered/parallelised)

    Parameters
    ----------
    client:
        A :class:`~gflow_cli.api.client.FlowApiClient` instance.
    recorder:
        An :class:`~gflow_cli.data.recorder.OperationRecorder` instance.
    profile_name:
        Name of the active gflow profile (forwarded to the recorder).
    profile_dir:
        Filesystem path of the active profile directory.
    project_id:
        The Flow project id to create the character in.
    name:
        Display name for the new character.
    face:
        Image-generation parameters for the face reference slot (slot 0).
    body:
        Image-generation parameters for the body reference slot (slot 1).
        ``None`` means a face-only character.
    voice:
        Optional preset voice id.
    personality:
        Optional personality notes (may be redacted by the recorder).
    locale:
        BCP-47 locale forwarded to ``generate_character_image``. ``None``
        (the default) means "use the ACCOUNT's own locale", resolved live
        from Flow — see #580. A hardcoded default silently routed every
        non-``en`` account to the wrong editor URL.
    format_prompt:
        Whether to click Flow's prompt-format button before submitting, which
        rewrites the prompt into Flow's character prompt-engineering shape.
