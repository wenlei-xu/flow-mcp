"""Chrome discovery and Playwright-channel helpers.

.. note::

   This module previously also shipped a packaged CDP (Chrome DevTools
   Protocol) attach/spawn lifecycle — ``get_or_launch_browser`` /
   ``close_browser`` / lockfile-managed detached Chrome — for research use
   and non-Flow use cases. It was removed 2026-07-19 (see
   ``.superpowers/sdd/cdp-decision.md`` in the
   ``chore/production-readiness-hardening`` history): zero production
   consumers shipped in the wheel, the no-lock attach path would connect to
   *any* Chrome answering on the port (a documented hijack vector), and the
   externally-discoverable CDP debug port this pattern relies on was itself
   rejected by Google's Flow surface on `aisandbox-pa.googleapis.com` in a
   2026-05-12 empirical test. The production transport is
   :class:`gflow_cli.api.transports.ui_automation.UiAutomationTransport`,
   which uses Playwright's internal CDP port (Playwright manages it
   privately, never externally exposed) rather than an externally-exposed
   debug port. CDP-attach as a distinct opt-in transport remains a parked
   backlog idea — see PLAN.md ADR #13 and the "CDP Attach Transport —
   BACKLOG" section — should a future contributor want to revisit it with a
   safe ownership model.

Single responsibility: locate the system Chrome binary and decide which
Playwright ``channel`` (if any) a given profile should launch with.

Public API
----------
is_chrome_available() -> bool
    True if a Google Chrome (or Chromium fallback) binary can be found.

resolved_chrome_binary() -> str | None
    The resolved Chrome binary path, or None. Never raises.

is_playwright_chrome_channel_available() -> bool
    True only if Google Chrome proper sits at one of the paths Playwright's
    ``channel="chrome"`` hard-codes. Stricter than ``is_chrome_available()``,
    which accepts Chromium; ``CHROME_BINARY`` does not satisfy it.

channel_for_profile(profile_dir) -> str | None
    ``"chrome"`` if the profile's strategy marker requests it AND Google
    Chrome proper is available at Playwright's expected paths; else None.

chrome_strategy_requested(profile_dir) -> bool
    True if the profile's ``.gflow_browser_strategy`` marker requests
    system Chrome (independent of whether Chrome is actually available).

ensure_profile_engine_compatible(profile_dir, channel) -> None
    Raise ``ProfileEngineDowngradeError`` when the bundled Chromium about to
    open ``profile_dir`` is older than the Chromium that last wrote it (#477).
