"""Sequential last-frame I2V chain orchestrator.

A *chain* renders a list of links into one continuous sequence: link 0 is a
text-to-video (T2V) generation, and every later link is an image-to-video (I2V)
generation seeded by the extracted last frame of the previous link's clip. The
result is visual continuity across links without any server-side stitching.

This module is the pure orchestration core (Task 7). CLI concerns — cost gate,
``--dry-run``, ``--max-links``, output naming policy — live in the command layer
(Task 8) and the DTO/transport layers it depends on. The orchestrator drives an
injected ``client`` (an async ``generate_video``), an injected ``extractor``
(defaulting to :func:`gflow_cli.media.extract_last_frame`), and an optional
``recorder`` for crash-safe persistence.

Key invariants:

* **Concurrency = 1.** Links run strictly sequentially; each I2V link depends on
  the previous link's output, so there is nothing to parallelise.
* **Reject-up-front.** A model chains cannot use (``omni_flash`` — single-clip
  start-frame i2v only, not proven at chain scale; refs #125) is rejected with
  :class:`ModelModeIncompatibilityError` BEFORE any spend.
* **Record-before-extract.** Once a link's clip is downloaded, the recorder is
  invoked BEFORE the frame extractor runs. A crash in the download->extract gap
  resumes at extraction, never re-generates the (already paid-for) clip.
* **Abort-preserves-partials.** A per-link :class:`WireFormatError` (i2v silently
  routed to the t2v backstop) or :class:`WafRejectionError` (HTTP 403) aborts the
  chain and raises :class:`ChainPartialError` carrying the ``Path`` of every link
  completed BEFORE the failure. The failing link's successors are never generated.
